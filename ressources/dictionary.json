In the VISUAL DICTIONARY, pictures define the annotations around them. You do not read definitions of the annotated words, you see them. The highly accessible format of the VISUAL DICTIONARY, the thoroughness of its annotations, and  the range of its subject matter make  it a unique and helpful reference tool.  annotated, color photographs showing the skin, muscles, and bones of the human hand. In this entry you will quickly find that the bone you are searching for is called the distal phalanx, and for good measure you will discover that it is attached to the middle phalanx by the distal interphalangeal joint.Perhaps you want to know what a catalytic converter looks like. If you look up \u201ccatalytic converter\u201d in an ordinary dictionary, you will be told what it is and possibly what it does\u2014but you will not be able to tell what shape it is or what it is made of. However, if you look up \u201ccatalytic converter\u201d in the index of the VISUAL DICTIONARY, you will be directed to the Modern engines entry on page 344\u2014where the introduction gives you basic information about what a catalytic converter is\u2014and to page 350\u2014where there is a spectacular exploded-view photograph of the mechanics of a Renault Clio. From these pages you will find out not only what a catalytic converter looks like, but also that it is attached at one end to an exhaust pipe and at the other to a muffler.Whatever it is that you want to find a name for, or whatever name you want to find a picture for, you will find it quickly and easily in the VISUAL DICTIONARY. Perhaps you need to know where the vamp on a shoe is; or how to tell obovate and lanceolate leaves apart; or what a spiral galaxy looks like; or whether birds have nostrils. With the VISUAL DICTIONARY at hand, the answers to each of these questions, and thousands more, are readily available.The VISUAL DICTIONARY does not just tell you what the names of the different parts of an object are. The photographs, illustrations, and annotations are all specially arranged to help you understand which parts relate to one another and how objects function. With the VISUAL DICTIONARY you can find in seconds the words or pictures that you are looking for; or  you can simply browse through the pages of the book for your own pleasure. The VISUAL DICTIONARY is not intended to replace a standard dictionary  or conventional encyclopedia, but is instead a stimulating and valuable companion to ordinary reference volumes. Giving you instant access to the language that is used by astronomers and architects, musicians and mechanics, scientists and sportspeople, it is the ideal reference book for specialists and generalists of all ages.You will find the VISUAL DICTIONARY simple to use. Instead of being organized alphabetically, it is divided by subject into 14 sections\u2014THE UNIVERSE, PREHISTORIC EARTH, PLANTS, ANIMALS, THE HUMAN BODY, etc. Each section begins with a table of contents listing the major entries within that section. For example, The Visual Arts section has entries on Drawing, Tempera, Fresco, Oils, Watercolor, Pastels, Acrylics, Calligraphy, Printmaking, Mosaic, and Sculpture. Every entry has a short introduction explaining the purpose of the photographs and illustrations, and the significance of the annotations.If you know what something looks like, but don\u2019t know its name, find the term you need by turning to the annotations surrounding the pictures; if you know a word, but don\u2019t know what it refers to, use the comprehensive index to direct you to the appropriate page.Suppose that you want to know what the bone  at the end of your little finger is called.

We cannot see the spiral shape because the solar system is in one of the spiral arms, the Orion Arm (also called the Local Arm).

However, a more complete picture can be obtained by studying radio, infrared, and other radiation. The central part of the Galaxy is relatively small and dense and contains mainly older red and yellow stars. The halo is a less dense region in which the oldest stars are situated; some of these stars are as old as the Galaxy itself (possibly 13 billion years). The spiral  arms contain main sequence stars and hot, young, blue stars, as well as nebulae (clouds of dust and  gas inside which stars are born). The Galaxy is vast, about 100,000 light-years across (a light-year is about 5,870 billion miles/9,460 billion km); in comparison, the solar system seems small, at about 12 light-hours across (about 8 billion miles/13 billion km). The entire Galaxy is rotating in space, although the inner stars travel faster than those farther out. The Sun, which is about two-thirds out from the center, completes one lap of the Galaxy about every 220 million years."

Among the best-known sights in the northern sky are the constellations Ursa Major  (the Great Bear) and Orion. Some ancient civilizations believed that the stars were fixed to a celestial sphere surrounding the Earth, and modern maps of the sky are based on a similar idea. The North and South Poles of this imaginary celestial sphere are directly above the North and South Poles of the Earth, at the points where the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation intersects the sphere. The celestial North Pole is at the center of the map shown here, and Polaris (the North Star) lies very close to it.

Among the best-known sights in the northern sky are the constellations Ursa Major  (the Great Bear) and Orion. Some ancient civilizations believed that the stars were fixed to a celestial sphere surrounding the Earth, and modern maps of the sky are based on a similar idea. The North and South Poles of this imaginary celestial sphere are directly above the North and South Poles of the Earth, at the points where the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation intersects the sphere. The celestial North Pole is at the center of the map shown here, and Polaris (the North Star) lies very close to it. The celestial equator marks a projection of the Earth\u2019s equator on the sphere. The ecliptic marks the path of the Sun across the sky  as the Earth orbits the Sun. The Moon and planets move against the background of the stars because the stars are much more distant; the nearest star outside the solar system (Proxima Centauri) is more  than 50,000 times farther away than  the planet Jupiter."

The energy emitted by a shining star is usually produced by nuclear fusion in the star\u2019s core. The brightness  of a star is measured in magnitudes\u2014the brighter the star, the lower its magnitude. There are two types of magnitude: apparent magnitude, which  is the brightness seen from Earth, and absolute magnitude, which is the brightness that would be seen from a standard distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years). The light emitted by a star may be split to form a spectrum containing a series of dark lines (absorption lines). The patterns of lines indicate the presence of particular chemical elements, enabling astronomers to deduce the composition of the star\u2019s atmosphere. The magnitude and spectral type (color) of stars may be plotted on a graph called a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which shows that  stars tend to fall into several well-defined groups.  The principal groups are main sequence stars (those  which are fusing hydrogen to form helium), giants, supergiants, and white dwarfs.The Sun (main sequence star; diameter 870,000 miles/1.4 million km)White dwarf (diameter of 2,000 to 30,000 miles/3,000 to 50,000 km)Neutrinos travel to Earth directly from Sun\u2019s core in about 8 minutesNuclear fusion in core produces gamma rays and neutrinosLower-energy radiation travels to Earth in about 8 minutesEarthLower-energy radiation (mainly ultraviolet, infrared, and light rays) leaves surfaceHigh-energy radiation (gamma rays) loses energy while traveling to surface over 2 million yearsSunPositronDeuterium nucleusProtonHelium-4 nucleusHelium-3 nucleusNeutrinoGamma raysProton (hydrogen nucleus)Sirius: absolute magnitude of +1.4Rigel: absolute magnitude of -7.1Brighter stars-9+90Sirius: apparent magnitude of -1.46Rigel: apparent magnitude of +0.12Objects of magnitude higher than about +6.0 cannot be seen by the naked eyeFainter starsRed giant from 10 to  100 million miles (15 to  150 million km) wideNeutron"

There are two types of magnitude: apparent magnitude, which  is the brightness seen from Earth, and absolute magnitude, which is the brightness that would be seen from a standard distance of 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years). The light emitted by a star may be split to form a spectrum containing a series of dark lines (absorption lines). The patterns of lines indicate the presence of particular chemical elements, enabling astronomers to deduce the composition of the star\u2019s atmosphere. The magnitude and spectral type (color) of stars may be plotted on a graph called a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which shows that  stars tend to fall into several well-defined groups.  The principal groups are main sequence stars (those  which are fusing hydrogen to form helium), giants, supergiants, and white dwarfs.Brighter stars-9+90Fainter stars"

A massive star evolves in a similar way to a small star until it reaches the main sequence stage (see pp. 24-25). During its life as a main sequence star, it shines steadily until the hydrogen in its core has fused to form helium. This process takes billions of years in a small star, but only millions of years in a massive star. A massive star then becomes a red supergiant, which initially consists of a helium core surrounded by outer layers of cooling, expanding gas. Over the next few million years, a series of nuclear reactions form different elements in shells around an iron core. The core eventually collapses in less than a second, causing a massive explosion called a supernova, in which a shock wave blows away the outer layers of the star. Supernovae shine brighter than an entire galaxy for a short time. Sometimes, the core survives the supernova explosion. If the surviving core is between about one and a half and three solar masses, it contracts to become a tiny, dense neutron star. If the core is greater than three solar masses,  it contracts to become a black hole (see pp. 28-29).About 2 million  miles (3 million km)Outer envelope consisting mainly of hydrogen"

A massive star evolves in a similar way to a small star until it reaches the main sequence stage (see pp. 24-25). During its life as a main sequence star, it shines steadily until the hydrogen in its core has fused to form helium. This process takes billions of years in a small star, but only millions of years in a massive star. A massive star then becomes a red supergiant, which initially consists of a helium core surrounded by outer layers of cooling, expanding gas. Over the next few million years, a series of nuclear reactions form different elements in shells around an iron core. The core eventually collapses in less than a second, causing a massive explosion called a supernova, in which a shock wave blows away the outer layers of the star. Supernovae shine brighter than an entire galaxy for a short time. Sometimes, the core survives the supernova explosion. If the surviving core is between about one and a half and three solar masses, it contracts to become a tiny, dense neutron star. If the core is greater than three solar masses,  it contracts to become a black hole (see pp. 28-29)."

These bodies include eight planets and their more than 160 known moons; dwarf planets; Kuiper Belt objects; asteroids; comets; and meteoroids. The solar system also contains interplanetary gas and dust. The planets fall into two groups: four small rocky planets near the Sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars); and four planets farther out, the giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Between the rocky planets and giants is the asteroid belt, which contains thousands of chunks of rock orbiting the Sun. Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt and, more distant, the Oort Cloud. Most of the bodies in the planetary part of the solar system move around the Sun in elliptical orbits located in a thin disk around the Sun\u2019s equator. All the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction (counterclockwise when viewed from above) and all but Venus and Uranus also spin about their axes in this direction.

These bodies include eight planets and their more than 160 known moons; dwarf planets; Kuiper Belt objects; asteroids; comets; and meteoroids. The solar system also contains interplanetary gas and dust. The planets fall into two groups: four small rocky planets near the Sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars); and four planets farther out, the giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Between the rocky planets and giants is the asteroid belt, which contains thousands of chunks of rock orbiting the Sun. Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt and, more distant, the Oort Cloud. Most of the bodies in the planetary part of the solar system move around the Sun in elliptical orbits located in a thin disk around the Sun\u2019s equator. All the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction (counterclockwise when viewed from above) and all but Venus and Uranus also spin about their axes in this direction. Moons also spin as they, in turn, orbit their planets.

It is about five billion years old and will continue to shine as it does now for about another five billion years. The Sun is a yellow main sequence star (see pp. 22-23) about 870,000 miles (1.4 million km) in diameter. It consists almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. In the Sun\u2019s core, hydrogen is converted to helium by nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process. The energy travels from the core, through the radiative and convective zones, to  the photosphere (visible surface), where it leaves the Sun in the form  of heat and light. On the photosphere there are often dark, relatively cool areas called sunspots, which usually appear in pairs or groups and are caused by the cooling effect of the magnetic field. Other types of solar activity are flares, which are usually associated with sunspots,  and prominences. Flares are sudden discharges of high-energy radiation and atomic particles. Prominences are huge loops or filaments of gas extending into the solar atmosphere; some last for hours, others for months. Beyond the photosphere is the chromosphere (inner atmosphere) and the extremely rarified corona (outer atmosphere), which extends millions of miles into space. Tiny particles that escape from the corona give rise to the solar wind, which streams through space at hundreds of miles per second.

Because Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it moves faster than any other planet, travelling at an average speed  of nearly 30 miles (48 km) per second and completing an orbit in just under 88 days. Mercury is very small (only  40 percent bigger than the Moon) and rocky. Most of the surface has been heavily cratered by the impact of meteorites, although there are also smooth, sparsely cratered lava-covered plains. The Caloris Basin is the largest crater, measuring about 800 miles (1,300 km) across.  It is thought to have been formed when a 38-mile- (60-km-) diameter  asteroid hit the planet, and is surrounded by concentric rings of mountains thrown up by the impact. The surface also has many clifflike ridges (called rupes) that are thought to have been formed when the hot core of the young planet cooled and shrank about four billion years ago, buckling the planet\u2019s surface in the process. The planet rotates about its axis very slowly, taking nearly 59 Earth days to complete  one rotation. As a result, a solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury is about 176 Earth days\u2014twice as long as the 88-day Mercurian year. Mercury has extreme surface temperatures, ranging from a maximum of 800°F (430°C) on the sunlit side to -270°F (-170°C) on the dark side. At nightfall, the temperature drops very quickly because the planet\u2019s atmosphere is almost nonexistent.

Venus spins slowly backwards as it orbits the Sun, causing its rotational period to be the longest in the solar system, at about 243 Earth days. It is slightly smaller than Earth and probably has a similar internal structure, consisting of a semisolid metal core, surrounded by a  rocky mantle and crust. Venus is the brightest object in  the sky after the Sun and Moon because its clouds reflect sunlight strongly. The main component of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, which traps heat in a greenhouse effect far stronger than that on  Earth. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet, with a maximum surface temperature of about 900°F (480°C). The thick cloud layers contain droplets  of sulfuric acid and are driven around the planet by winds at speeds of up to  220 miles (360 km) per hour. Although the planet takes 243 Earth days to  rotate once, the high-speed winds cause the clouds to circle the planet in only four Earth days. The high temperature, acidic clouds, and enormous atmospheric pressure (about 90 times greater at the surface than that on Earth) make the environment extremely hostile. However, space probes have managed to land on Venus and photograph its dry, dusty surface. The Venusian surface has also been mapped by probes with radar equipment that can \u201csee\u201d through the cloud layers. Such radar maps reveal a terrain with craters, mountains, volcanoes, and areas where craters have been covered by plains of solidified volcanic lava.

It is the largest and the most massive planet, with a diameter about 11 times that of the Earth and a mass about 2.5 times the combined mass of the seven other planets. Jupiter is thought to have a small rocky core surrounded by an inner mantle of metallic hydrogen (liquid hydrogen that acts like a metal). Outside the inner mantle is an outer mantle of liquid hydrogen and helium that merges into the gaseous atmosphere. Jupiter\u2019s rapid rate of rotation causes the clouds in its atmosphere to form belts and zones that encircle the planet parallel to the equator. Belts are dark, low-lying, relatively warm cloud layers, and zones are bright, high-altitude, cooler cloud layers. Within the belts and zones, turbulence causes the formation of cloud features such as white ovals and red spots, both of which are huge storm systems. The most prominent cloud feature is a storm called the Great Red Spot, which consists of a spiraling column of clouds three times wider than the Earth that rises about five miles (8 km) above the upper cloud layer. Jupiter has a thin, faint, main ring, inside which is a tenuous halo ring of tiny particles. Beyond the main ring\u2019s outer edge is a broad and faint two-part gossamer ring. There are 63 known Jovian moons. The four largest moons (called the Galileans) are Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa. Ganymede and Callisto are cratered and icy. Europa is smooth and icy and is thought to have a subsurface water ocean. Io is covered in bright red, orange, and yellow splotches. This coloring is caused by sulfurous material from active volcanoes that shoot plumes of lava hundreds of miles above the surface.Axis of rotationNorth PolePerpendicular to orbital planeAxial tilt of 3.1°Orbital planeOne rotation takes 9 hours and 55 minutesSouth PoleGreat Red Spot (anticyclonic storm system)Red color probably due to phosphorusWhite oval (temporary anticyclonic storm system)Diameter: 1,950 miles Average distance from planet: 416,900 milesDiameter: 2,983 miles Average distance from planet: 1,168,200 milesDiameter: 3,270 miles Average distance from planet: 664,900 milesDiameter: 2,263 miles Average distance from planet: 262,100 milesHalo ringMain ring"

It is thought to consist of a dense mixture of different types of ice and gas around a solid core. Its atmosphere contains traces of methane, giving the planet a blue-green hue, and the temperature at the cloud tops is about -350°F (-210°C). Uranus is the most featureless planet to have been closely observed: only a few icy clouds of methane have been seen so far. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axis of rotation lies close to its orbital plane. As a result of its strongly tilted rotational axis, Uranus rolls on its side along its orbital path around the Sun, whereas other planets spin more or less upright. Uranus is encircled by main rings that consist of rocks interspersed with dust lanes and two distant outer rings made of dust. The  rings contain some of the darkest matter in the solar system and are extremely narrow, making them difficult to detect: most of them are less than 6 miles (10 km) wide, whereas most of Saturn\u2019s rings are thousands of miles in width. There are 27 known Uranian moons, all of which are icy and most of which are farther out than the rings. The 13 inner moons are small and dark, with diameters of less than 100 miles (160 km), and the five major moons are between about 290 and 1,000 miles (470 and 1,600 km) in diameter.

Unlike most moons in the solar system, Triton orbits its mother planet in the opposite direction of the planet\u2019s rotation.  The region extending out from Neptune\u2019s orbit is populated by Kuiper Belt objects and dwarf planets. They make a doughnut-shaped belt called the Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt objects are a mix of rock and ice, irregular in shape, and less than 600 miles (1,000 km) across. The larger dwarf planets, which include Pluto, are almost round bodies. Pluto was the first object discovered beyond Neptune and was considered a planet until the dwarf planet category was introduced in 2006.

Most of them orbit the Sun in the asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

It includes continental crust (about 25 miles/40 km thick) and oceanic crust (about four miles/6 km thick). The crust and the topmost layer of the mantle form the lithosphere. The lithosphere consists of semirigid plates that move relative to each other on the underlying asthenosphere (a partly molten layer of the mantle). This process is known as plate tectonics and helps explain continental drift. Where two plates move apart, there are rifts in the crust. In mid-ocean, this movement results  in seafloor spreading and the formation of ocean ridges; on continents, crustal spreading can form rift valleys. When plates move toward each other, one may be subducted beneath (forced under) the other. In mid-ocean, this causes ocean trenches, seismic activity, and arcs of volcanic islands. Where oceanic crust is subducted beneath continental crust or where continents collide, land may be uplifted and mountains formed (see pp. 62\u201365). Plates may also slide past each other\u2014along the San Andreas fault, for example. Crustal movement on continents may result in earthquakes, while movement under the seabed can lead to tidal waves.Other elements 2%Potassium 2.6%Calcium 3.6%Magnesium 2%Aluminum 8%Iron 5%Sodium 2.8%Silicon 28%Oxygen 46% Subduction zoneRift formed where two plates are moving apartMagma (molten rock) erupts at riftMagma rises to form a hot spotVolcano develops over hot spot and builds up to form an islandVolcanic island that originally formed over hot spotOceanic crust meltsMagma rises to form a volcanoOcean trench formed where oceanic crust is forced under continental crustRidge where magma is rising to form new oceanic crustRegion of seafloor spreading"

Where oceanic crust is subducted beneath continental crust or where continents collide, land may be uplifted and mountains formed (see pp. 62\u201365). Plates may also slide past each other\u2014along the San Andreas fault, for example. Crustal movement on continents may result in earthquakes, while movement under the seabed can lead to tidal waves."

This landmass experienced extremes of climate, with lush green areas around the coast or by lakes and rivers, and arid deserts in the interior. The only forms of plant life were nonflowering plants, such as conifers, ferns, cycads, and ginkgos; flowering plants had not yet evolved.

Theropods spanned the age of most dinosaurs (230\u201365 million years ago) and beyond, and included most of the known predatory dinosaurs. The typical theropod had smallish arms with sharp, clawed fingers; powerful jaws lined with sharp teeth; an S-shaped neck; long, muscular hind limbs; and clawed, usually four-toed feet. Many theropods may have been warm-blooded; most were exclusively carnivorous. Theropods ranged from animals no larger than  a chicken to huge creatures, such as Tyrannosaurus and Baryonyx. The group also included ostrichlike omnivores and herbivores with toothless beaks, such as Struthiomimus and Gallimimus. Birds are dinosaurs and evolved from within a group of tetanuran theropods called maniraptorans. Archaeopteryx, small and feathered, was the first known bird and lived alongside other dinosaurs.Supraoccipital crestOrbitNarisCervical vertebraeCraniumMetatarsalsPhalangesRibPhalangesScapulaCervical ribElbow jointWrist jointHumerusMandibleCoracoidShoulder jointUlnaMetacarpalsTibiaSerrated toothTailNarisEyeThighAnkleFootKneeHind limbToeClawScaly skinForelimbHandHip jointMetatarsalHallux (first toe)Dorsal vertebraeCommon digital extensor muscleClawAnterior tibial muscleFemoro-tibial muscleAmbiens muscleIlio-tibial muscleIlio-femoral muscleIliumToeDigital flexor muscleFibulaTarsalGastrocnemius muscleIlio-fibular muscleFemurFemoro-tibial muscleInternal tibial flexor muscleFemurIschiumKnee jointPubisAnkle jointFibula"

Theropods spanned the age of most dinosaurs (230\u201365 million years ago) and beyond, and included most of the known predatory dinosaurs. The typical theropod had smallish arms with sharp, clawed fingers; powerful jaws lined with sharp teeth; an S-shaped neck; long, muscular hind limbs; and clawed, usually four-toed feet. Many theropods may have been warm-blooded; most were exclusively carnivorous.

Prosauropods lived from Late Triassic to Early Jurassic times (225\u2013180 million years ago) and included beasts such as the small Anchisaurus and one of the first very large dinosaurs, Plateosaurus. By Middle Jurassic times (about 165 million years ago), sauropods had replaced prosauropods and spread worldwide. They included the heaviest and longest land animals ever, such as Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus. Sauropods persisted to the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago). Many of these dinosaurs moved in herds, protected from predatory theropods by their huge bulk and powerful  tails, which they could use to lash out at attackers. Sauropodomorphs  were the most common large herbivores until Late Jurassic  times (about 145 million years ago), and appear to have survived in both southern and northern continents until the end of the Cretaceous period.NarisAntorbital fenestraOrbitMandibleInfratemporal fenestraParoccipital processSerrated, leaf-shaped toothMandibular fenestraSacral vertebraeDorsal vertebraeCervical vertebraeHumerusShoulder jointPubisHip jointIliumIschiumTailFemurKnee jointTibiaFibulaAnkle jointMetatarsalsRibElbow jointRadiusUlnaMetacarpalWrist jointThumb-clawCraniumOrbitMandiblePhalanxPhalanges ScapulaNaris"

By Middle Jurassic times (about 165 million years ago), sauropods had replaced prosauropods and spread worldwide. They included the heaviest and longest land animals ever, such as  and . Sauropods persisted to the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago). Many of these dinosaurs moved in herds, protected from predatory theropods by their huge bulk and powerful  tails, which they could use to lash out at attackers. Sauropodomorphs  were the most common large herbivores until Late Jurassic  times (about 145 million years ago), and appear to have survived in both southern and northern continents until the end of the Cretaceous period."

The bony frill of Ceratopsia would have added to their frightening appearance when charging; the neck was strengthened for impact  and to support the huge head, with its snipping beak and powerful slicing toothed jaws.

Mammals had several features that differed from those of their ancestors: an efficient four-chambered heart allowed these warm-blooded animals  to sustain high levels of activity; a covering of hair helped them maintain a constant body temperature; an improved limb structure gave them more efficient locomotion; and the birth of live young and the immediate supply of food from the mother\u2019s milk aided their rapid growth. Since the end of the Mesozoic era (65 million years ago), the number of major mammal groups and the abundance of species in each have varied dramatically. For example, the Perissodactyla (the group that includes Coelodonta and modern horses) was a common group during the Early Tertiary period (about 54 million years ago). Today, the mammalian groups with the most species include the Rodentia (rats and mice), the Chiroptera (bats), the Primates (monkeys and apes), the Carnivora (bears, cats, and dogs), and the Artiodactyla (cattle, deer, and pigs), while the Proboscidea group, which formerly included many genera, such as Phiomia, Moeritherium, Tetralophodon, and Mammuthus, now has only three species of elephant. In Australia and South America, millions of years  of continental isolation led to increased diversity  of the marsupials, a group of mammals  distinct from the placentals (see p. 74)  that existed elsewhere.NarisPremaxilla boneChisel-edged molarOrbitMandiblePhalanxMetacarpalUlnaRadiusHumerusNasal hornInsulating hairNeural spineScapulaCervical vertebraLong tail aids balance"

Neanderthals, a near relative of modern humans, originated about 200,000 years ago, and Homo sapiens (modern humans) appeared in Africa about 100,000 years later. The two coexisted for thousands of years, but by 30,000 years ago, Homo sapiens had become dominant and the Neanderthals had died out.

Bryophytes do not have true stems, leaves, or roots (they are anchored to the ground by rhizoids), nor do they have the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) that transport water and nutrients in higher plants. With no outer, waterproof cuticle, bryophytes are susceptible to drying out, and most grow in moist habitats. The bryophyte life-cycle has two stages. In stage one, the green plant (gametophyte) produces male and female gametes (sex cells), which fuse to form a zygote.

Bryophytes do not have true stems, leaves, or roots (they are anchored to the ground by rhizoids), nor do they have the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) that transport water and nutrients in higher plants. With no outer, waterproof cuticle, bryophytes are susceptible to drying out, and most grow in moist habitats. The bryophyte life-cycle has two stages. In stage one, the green plant (gametophyte) produces male and female gametes (sex cells), which fuse to form a zygote. In stage two, the zygote develops into a sporophyte that remains attached to the gametophyte. The sporophyte produces spores, which are released and germinate into new green plants.

Typically, gymnosperms are woody, perennial shrubs or trees, with stems, leaves, and roots, and a well-developed vascular (transportat) system. The reproductive structures in most gymnosperms are cones: male cones produce microspores in which male gametes (sex cells) develop; female cones produce megaspores in which female gametes develop. Microspores are blown by the wind to female cones, male and female gametes fuse during fertilization, and a seed develops. The four gymnosperm phyla are the conifers (phylum Coniferophyta), mostly tall trees; cycads (phylum Cycadophyta), small palmlike trees; the ginkgo or maidenhair tree (phylum Ginkgophyta), a tall tree with bilobed leaves; and gnetophytes (phylum Gnetophyta), a diverse group of plants, mainly shrubs, but also including the horizontally growing welwitschia.Microsporangium (structure in which pollen grains are formed)Axis of coneFrayed end of leafOvuliferous scale (ovule- then seed- bearing structure)Axis of coneBract scaleOvule (contains female gametes)Microsporophyll (modified leaf carrying microsporangia)Scale leafPoint of attachment to axis of coneSeedWing of seed derived from ovuliferous scaleOvuliferous scale (ovule- then seed-bearing structure)Pine(Pinus sp.)Wing scarSeedSeed scar(Pinus sylvestris)Needle (foliage leaf)ConeOvuliferous scale (ovule- then seed- bearing structure)Pollen grain in micropyle (entrance to ovule)Ovuliferous scaleOvule (contains female gamete)Pollen grainNucleusAir sacIntegument (outer part of ovule)Pollen tube (carries male gamete from pollen grain to ovum)Archegonium (containing female gamete)SeedSeedWingPlumule (embryonic shoot)Cotyledon (seed leaf)Root(Welwitschia mirabilis)Ovuliferous scale (ovule- then seed-bearing structure)"

Dicotyledons have seeds with two cotyledons; leaves are broad with a central midrib and branched veins; flower parts occur in multiples of four or five; sepals are generally small and green; petals are large and colorful; vascular bundles are arranged in a ring around the edge of the stem; and, because many dicotyledons possess wood-producing stem cambium, there are woody forms (see pp. 130-131) as well as herbaceous ones.Vein (parallel venation)LeafletPetiole (leaf stalk)Emerging leafLeaf baseAdventitious rootParadise palm(Howea forsteriana)Collenchyma (supporting tissue)VeinEpidermis (outer layer  of cells)Parenchyma (packing tissue)MidribPhloemXylemVascular tissueCrab apple (Malus sp.)StigmaFilamentAntherStamenPollen on antherPetalHibiscus(Hibiscus rosa-sinensis)Funnel guide for bird pollinators\u2019 beakLabellum (lip) forming landing stage for pollinatorOrchid(Phalaenopsis sp.)Guide hairColumn (stamens and style)Lateral, inner tepal (monocotyledonous petal)Yucca (Yucca sp.)Outer tepal (monocotyledonous sepal)Sclerenchyma (strengthening tissue)Epidermis (outer layer of cells)Cuticle (waterproof covering)Sunken stoma (pore)Spongy mesophyll (loosely packed photosynthetic tissue)Palisade mesophyll (tightly packed photosynthetic tissue)Vascular tissueXylemPhloemVeinMesophyll (photosynthetic tissue)Water-absorbing parenchyma (packing  tissue)"

Their component parts are arranged in whorls around the receptacle (tip of the flower stalk). The sepals (collectively called the calyx) are outermost; typically small and green, they protect the developing flower. The petals (collectively called the corolla) are typically large and brightly colored; they are found inside  the sepals. In monocotyledonous flowers (see pp. 126-127), sepals  and petals are indistinguishable; individually they are called tepals (collectively called the perianth). The petals surround the male and female reproductive structures (androecium and gynoecium). The androecium consists of stamens (male organs); each stamen is made up of a filament (stalk) and anther. The gynoecium has one or more carpels (female organs); each carpel consists of an ovary, style, and stigma. Some flowers (e.g., lily) occur singly on a pedicel (flower stalk); others (e.g., elder, sunflower) are arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle (inflorescence stalk).AntherOuter tepal (monocotyledonous sepal)Inner tepal (monocotyledonous petal)Inner tepal (monocotyledonous petal)Syncarpous (fused carpels) gynoeciumHoney guide"

This process precedes fertilization (see pp. 146-147). Pollination may occur within the same flower (self-pollination), or between flowers on separate plants of the same species (cross-pollination). In most plants, pollination is carried out either by insects (entomophilous pollination) or by the wind (anemophilous pollination). Less commonly, birds, bats, or water are the agents of pollination. Insect-pollinated flowers are typically brightly colored, scented, and produce nectar, on which insects feed. Such flowers also tend to have patterns that are visible only in ultraviolet light, which many insects can see but which humans cannot. These features attract insects, which become covered with the sticky or hooked pollen grains when they visit one flower, and then transfer the pollen to the next flower they visit. Wind-pollinated flowers are generally small, relatively inconspicuous, and unscented.

Following pollination (see pp. 144-145), the pollen grains that contain the male gametes are on the stigma, some distance from the female gamete (ovum) inside the ovule. To enable the gametes to meet, the pollen grain germinates and produces a pollen tube, which grows down and enters the embryo sac (the inner part of the ovule that contains the ovum). Two male gametes, traveling at the tip of the pollen tube, enter the embryo sac. One gamete fuses with the ovum to produce a zygote that  will develop into an embryo plant. The other male gamete fuses with two polar nuclei to produce the endosperm, which acts as a food  supply for the developing embryo. Fertilization also initiates other changes: the integument (outer part of ovule) forms a testa (seed coat) around the embryo and endosperm; the petals fall off; the stigma and style wither; and the ovary wall forms a layer (called the pericarp) around the seed. Together, the pericarp and seed form the fruit, which may be succulent (see pp. 148-149) or dry (see pp. 150-151).

A seed consists of an embryo and its food supply, surrounded by a testa (seed coat). The embryo is made up of one or two cotyledons (seed leaves) attached to a central axis. The upper part of the axis consists of an epicotyl, which has a plumule (embryonic shoot) at its tip. The lower part of the axis consists of a hypocotyl and a radicle (embryonic root). After dispersal from the parent plant, the seeds dehydrate and enter a period of dormancy. Following this dormant period, germination begins, provided that the seeds have enough water, oxygen, warmth, and, in some cases, light.  In the first stages of germination, the seed takes in water; the embryo starts to use its food supply; and the radicle swells, breaks through the testa, and grows downward. Germination then proceeds in one of two ways, depending on the type of seed. In epigeal germination, the hypocotyl lengthens, pulling the plumule and its protective cotyledons out of the soil. In hypogeal germination, the cotyledons remain below ground and the epicotyl lengthens, pushing the plumule upward.Hypocotyl (region between epicotyl and radicle) Cotyledons (seed leaves) remain within testa (seed coat) below soil\u2019s surfacePrimary rootLateral rootEpidermisVascular tissue (xylem and phloem)Cortex Hilum (point of attachment to ovary)Epicotyl (upper part of axis) lengthensPlumule (embryonic shoot)Testa (seed coat)Cataphyll (scale leaf of plumule)Young shootSplit in testa (seed coat) due to expanding cotyledonsLateral root systemRadicle (embryonic root)Cotyledons (seed leaves) remain food source for the seedlingEpicotyl (upper part of axis) Fava bean(Vicia faba)Cotyledon (seed leaf)Cotyledon (seed leaf)Testa (seed coat)Root tip (region of cell division)Primary rootCataphyll (scale leaf of plumule) Epicotyl increases in length and turns green Stipule (structure at base of leaf) Cotyledon (seed leaf)Foliage leafCotyledon (seed leaf)Radicle (embryonic root)Hypocotyl (region between epicotyl and radicle)Epicotyl (upper part of axis)Plumule (embryonic shoot)"

                        "content": "GERMINATION IS THE GROWTH OF SEEDS INTO SEEDLINGS. It starts when seeds become active below ground, and ends when the first foliage leaves appear above ground. A seed consists of an embryo and its food supply, surrounded by a testa (seed coat). The embryo is made up of one or two cotyledons (seed leaves) attached to a central axis. The upper part of the axis consists of an epicotyl, which has a plumule (embryonic shoot) at its tip. The lower part of the axis consists of a hypocotyl and a radicle (embryonic root). After dispersal from the parent plant, the seeds dehydrate and enter a period of dormancy. Following this dormant period, germination begins, provided that the seeds have enough water, oxygen, warmth, and, in some cases, light.  In the first stages of germination, the seed takes in water; the embryo starts to use its food supply; and the radicle swells, breaks through the testa, and grows downward. Germination then proceeds in one of two ways, depending on the type of seed. In epigeal germination, the hypocotyl lengthens, pulling the plumule and its protective cotyledons out of the soil. In hypogeal germination, the cotyledons remain below ground and the epicotyl lengthens, pushing the plumule upward.Fava bean()"

All are found in places where little water is available; some live in high temperatures that cause excessive loss of water from the leaves. Xerophytes show a number of adaptations to dry conditions; these include reduced leaf area, rolled leaves, sunken stomata, hairs, spines, and thick cuticles. One group, succulent plants, stores water in specially enlarged spongy tissues found in leaves, roots, or stems. Leaf succulents have enlarged, fleshy, water-storing leaves. Root succulents have a large, underground water-storage organ with short-lived stems and leaves above ground. Stem succulents are represented by the cacti (family Cactaceae). Cacti stems are fleshy, green, and photosynthetic; they are typically ribbed or covered by tubercles in rows, with leaves being reduced to spines or entirely absent.Spine (modified leaf)RootTubercle (projection from stem surface)Waxy cuticle (waterproof covering)Water-storing parenchyma (packing tissue)Stoma (pore) controlling exchange of gasesSinuous (wavy) cell wallTrichome (hair)Spine (modified leaf)Lithops sp.Areole (modified lateral shoot)Spine (modified leaf)Waxy cuticle (waterproof covering)Tubercle (projection from stem surface)RootVascular cylinder (transport tissue)Tubercle (projection from stem surface)Golden barrel cactus(Echinocactus grusonii)Areole (modified lateral shoot) "

The nutrients absorbed from trapped insects enable carnivorous plants to thrive in acid, boggy soils that lack essential minerals, especially nitrates, where most other plants could not survive. All carnivorous plants have some leaves modified as traps; many use bright colors and scented nectar to attract prey; and most use enzymes to digest the prey. There are three types of traps. Pitcher plants, such as the monkey cup and cobra lily, have leaves modified as pitcher-shaped pitfall traps, half-filled with water; once lured inside the mouth of the trap, insects lose their footing on the slippery surface, fall into the liquid, and either decompose or are digested. Venus fly traps use a spring-trap mechanism; when an insect touches trigger hairs on the inner surfaces of the leaves, the two lobes of the trap snap shut. Butterworts and sundews entangle prey by sticky droplets on the leaf surface, while the edges of the leaves slowly curl over to envelop and digest the prey.Cobra lily (Darlingtonia californica)Fishtail nectaryWingPitcherTubular petiole (leaf stalk)Areola (\u201cwindow\u201d of transparent tissue)Smooth surfaceDome-shaped hood developsFishtail nectary appearsImmature pitcherWingMouthDownward pointing hairImmature trapClosed trapRed color of trap attracts insectsSensory hingeInner surface of trapTrap (twin-lobed leaf blade)Digestive glandLobe  of trapMidrib (hinge of trap)Trigger hairToothDigestive zone (glands secrete digestive enzymes)Nectary zone (glands secrete nectar)Summer petiole (leaf stalk)Phyllode (flattened petiole)(Dionaea muscipula)Areola (\u201cwindow\u201d of transparent tissue)HoodNectar rollTrigger hairSpring petiole (leaf stalk)Interlocked teeth"

The nutrients absorbed from trapped insects enable carnivorous plants to thrive in acid, boggy soils that lack essential minerals, especially nitrates, where most other plants could not survive. All carnivorous plants have some leaves modified as traps; many use bright colors and scented nectar to attract prey; and most use enzymes to digest the prey. There are three types of traps.

Insects, including beetles, ants, bees, butterflies, and moths, belong to various orders in the class Insecta, which is a division of the phylum Arthropoda. Features common to all insects are an exoskeleton (external skeleton); three pairs of jointed legs; three body sections (head, thorax, and abdomen); and one pair of sensory antennae. Beetles (order Coleoptera) are the biggest group of insect, with about 300,000 species (about 30 percent of all known insects). They have a pair of hard elytra (wing cases), which are modified front wings. The principal function of the elytra is to protect the hind wings, which are used for flying. Ants, together with bees and wasps, form the order Hymenoptera, which contains about 200,000 species. This group is characterized by a marked narrowing between the thorax and abdomen. Butterflies and moths form the order Lepidoptera, which has about 150,000 species. They have wings covered with tiny scales, hence the name of their order (Lepidoptera means \u201cscale wings\u201d). The separation of lepidopterans into butterflies and moths is largely artificial, since there are no features that categorically distinguish one group from the other. In general, however, most butterflies fly by day, whereas most moths are night-flyers. Some insects, including butterflies and moths, undergo complete metamorphosis (transformation) during their life-cycle. A butterfly metamorphoses from an egg to a larva (caterpillar), then to a pupa (chrysalis), and finally to an imago (adult)."

Also sometimes known as elasmobranchs, sharks and their relatives have a skeleton made of cartilage (hence their common name, cartilaginous fish), a characteristic that distinguishes them from bony fish (see pp. 180-181). Other important features of cartilaginous fish are extremely tough, toothlike scales, and lack of a swim bladder. Jawless fish\u2014 lampreys and hagfish\u2014are primitive, eellike fish that make up the order Cyclostomata (meaning \u201cround mouths\u201d), a division of the superclass Agnatha (meaning \u201cwithout jaws\u201d). In addition to their characteristic round, suckerlike mouths and lack of jaws, cyclostomes also have smooth, slimy skin without scales, and unpaired fins.EyeEye"

Also sometimes known as elasmobranchs, sharks and their relatives have a skeleton made of cartilage (hence their common name, cartilaginous fish), a characteristic that distinguishes them from bony fish (see pp. 180-181). Other important features of cartilaginous fish are extremely tough, toothlike scales, and lack of a swim bladder. Jawless fish\u2014 lampreys and hagfish\u2014are primitive, eellike fish that make up the order Cyclostomata (meaning \u201cround mouths\u201d), a division of the superclass Agnatha (meaning \u201cwithout jaws\u201d). In addition to their characteristic round, suckerlike mouths and lack of jaws, cyclostomes also have smooth, slimy skin without scales, and unpaired fins."

The ungulates are divided into two orders on the basis of the number of toes. Members of the order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) have one or three toes. Perissodactyls include horses, onagers, and zebras (all of which are one-toed), and rhinoceroses and tapirs (which are three-toed). Members of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) have two or four toes. Most artiodactyls have two toes, which are typically encased in hooves to give the so-called cloven hoof. Two-toed, cloven-hoofed artiodactyls include cows and other cattle, sheep, goats, antelopes, deer, and giraffes. The other main two-toed artiodactyls are camels and llamas. Most two-toed artiodactyls are ruminants; that is, they have a four-chambered stomach and chew the cud. The principal four-toed artiodactyls are pigs, peccaries, and hippopotamuses.Chambers of stomachRumenOmasumAbomasumReticulumColonAnusRectumSmall intestineDuodenumMouthEsophagusBackRoot of tailButtockTailThigh2nd metacarpal (splint bone)Fused 3rd and 4th metacarpals3rd metacarpal (cannon bone)Sesamoid boneSesamoid bonePhalanges of 4th digitHoof bone of 3rd digitHoof bone of 4th digitPhalanges of 3rd digitPhalanges of 3rd digitHoof boneHeelCoronetHoofShannon bone (cannon bone)ChestnutHockGaskinStifleBellyTonguePasternFlankCecumCroupLoin"

The order Marsupalia, the pouched mammals, is made up of kangaroos and their relatives. Typically, marsupials give birth to their young at a very early stage of development. The young then crawls to the mother\u2019s pouch (which is on the outside of her abdomen), where it attaches itself to a nipple and remains until fully developed. Most marsupials live in Australia, although the opossums\u2014which are classified as marsupials despite not having a pouch\u2014live in the Americas. The order Monotremata is made up of the platypus and its relatives (the echidnas, or spiny anteaters). The monotremes are primitive mammals that lay eggs, which the mother incubates. The monotremes are found only in Australia and New Guinea.Thoracic vertebraeCervical vertebraeMandibleScapulaClavicleHumerusSternumRadiusUlnaCarpalsLumbar vertebraeCaudal vertebraePhalangesRibTibia RibFibulaPatellaTibiaFemurUlnaRadiusHumerusTarsalsPhalangesPelvis1st caudal vertebra1st lumbar vertebraOrbitSkull1st cervical vertebraScapulaPhalangesFibulaTailTarsalsCarpalsPhalangesMetacarpalsMetatarsals1st thoracic vertebraMetatarsalsPelvisSacrumFemurMetacarpalsSkull"

The order Marsupalia, the pouched mammals, is made up of kangaroos and their relatives. Typically, marsupials give birth to their young at a very early stage of development. The young then crawls to the mother\u2019s pouch (which is on the outside of her abdomen), where it attaches itself to a nipple and remains until fully developed. Most marsupials live in Australia, although the opossums\u2014which are classified as marsupials despite not having a pouch\u2014live in the Americas. The order Monotremata is made up of the platypus and its relatives (the echidnas, or spiny anteaters). The monotremes are primitive mammals that lay eggs, which the mother incubates. The monotremes are found only in Australia and New Guinea."

Contained in the head are  the body\u2019s main sense organs: eyes, ears, olfactory nerves that detect smells, and the taste buds of the tongue. Signals from these organs pass to the body\u2019s great coordination center: the brain, housed in the protective, bony dome of the skull. Hair on the head insulates against heat loss, and adult males also grow thick facial hair. The face has three important openings: two nostrils through which air passes, and the mouth, which takes in nourishment and helps form speech. Although all heads are basically similar, differences in the size, shape, and color of features produce an infinite variety of appearances."

The spine consists of 24 separate differently shaped bones (vertebrae) with a curved, triangular bone (the sacrum) at  the bottom. The sacrum is made up of fused vertebrae; at its lower end is a small tail-like structure made up of tiny bones collectively called the coccyx. Between each pair of vertebrae  is a disk of cartilage that cushions the bones during movement. The top two vertebrae differ in appearance from the others and work as a pair: the first, called the atlas, rotates around a stout vertical peg on the second, the axis. This arrangement allows the skull to move freely up and down, and from side to side.Anterior archAnterior tubercleVertebral foramenTransverse processSkullTransverse foramenPosterior tubercleFacetDensSpinous processAnterior tuberclePosterior tubercleLaminaTransverse process and foramenTransverse foramenVertebral foramenSpinous processSuperior articular processBodyVertebral foramenCoccygeal vertebraeSacral vertebraeLumbar vertebraeThoracic vertebraeCervical vertebraeThoracic vertebraeCervical vertebraePosterior archLateral mass with superior articular facetAtlasAxis1st1st2nd2nd3rd3rd4th4th5th5th6th6th7th7th"

The spine consists of 24 separate differently shaped bones (vertebrae) with a curved, triangular bone (the sacrum) at  the bottom. The sacrum is made up of fused vertebrae; at its lower end is a small tail-like structure made up of tiny bones collectively called the coccyx. Between each pair of vertebrae  is a disk of cartilage that cushions the bones during movement. The top two vertebrae differ in appearance from the others and work as a pair: the first, called the atlas, rotates around a stout vertical peg on the second, the axis. This arrangement allows the skull to move freely up and down, and from side to side."

Three distinct regions can easily be seen\u2014the brainstem, the cerebellum,  and the large cerebrum. The brainstem controls vital body functions, such as breathing and digestion.

It is also responsible for the complexities of thought, memory, emotion, and language. In adults, this complex organ is a mere 3 lb (1.4 kg) in  weight, containing over 10 billion nerve cells. Three distinct regions can easily be seen\u2014the brainstem, the cerebellum,  and the large cerebrum. The brainstem controls vital body functions, such as breathing and digestion. The cerebellum\u2019s main functions are the maintenance of posture and the coordination of body movements. The cerebrum, which consists of the right and left cerebral hemispheres joined  by the corpus callosum, is the site of most conscious and intelligent activities."

At rest the heart beats between 60 and 80 times a minute; during exercise or at times of stress or excitement the rate may  increase to 200 beats a minute.Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium while the left atrium receives oxygenated blood."

Rocks can be divided into three main groups: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed when magma (molten rock) from the Earth\u2019s interior cools and solidifies (see pp. 274-275). Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediment (rock particles, for example) becomes compressed and cemented together in a process known as lithification (see pp. 276-277). Metamorphic rocks are formed when igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks are changed by heat or pressure (see pp. 274-275). Rocks are added to the Earth\u2019s surface by crustal movements and volcanic activity. Once exposed on the surface, the rocks are broken down into rock particles by weathering (see pp. 282-283). The particles are then transported by glaciers, rivers, and wind, and deposited as sediment in lakes, deltas, deserts, and on the ocean floor. Some of this sediment undergoes lithification and forms sedimentary rock. This rock may be thrust back to the surface by crustal movements or forced deeper into the Earth\u2019s interior, where heat and pressure transform it into metamorphic rock. The metamorphic rock in turn may be pushed up to the surface or may be melted to form magma. Eventually, the magma cools and solidifies-below or on the surface-forming igneous rock. When the sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks are exposed once more on the Earth\u2019s surface, the cycle begins again.Main conduitVentSecondary conduitLava flowAshLavaMagma extruded as lava, which solidifies to form igneous rockRock surrounding magma changed by heat to form metamorphic rockSedimentary rock crushed and folded to form metamorphic rockIntense heat of rising magma melts some of the surrounding rock"

There are two main types of igneous rock: intrusive and extrusive. Intrusive rocks are formed deep underground where magma is forced into cracks or between rock layers to form structures such as sills, dikes, and batholiths. The magma cools slowly to form coarse-grained rocks such as gabbro and pegmatite. Extrusive rocks are formed above the Earth\u2019s surface from lava (magma that has been ejected in a volcanic eruption). The molten lava cools quickly, producing fine-grained rocks such as rhyolite and basalt. Metamorphic rocks are those that have been altered by intense heat (contact metamorphism) or extreme pressure (regional metamorphism). Contact metamorphism occurs when rocks are changed by heat from, for example, an igneous intrusion or lava flow. Regional metamorphism occurs when rock is crushed in the middle of a folding mountain range. Metamorphic rocks can be formed from igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, or even from other metamorphic rocks.

Physical weathering may be caused by temperature changes, such as freezing and thawing, or by abrasion from material carried by winds, rivers, or glaciers. Rocks may also be broken down by the actions of animals and plants, such as the burrowing of animals and the growth of roots. Chemical weathering causes rocks to decompose by changing their chemical composition\u2014for example, rainwater may dissolve certain minerals in a rock. Erosion is the wearing away and removal of land surfaces by water, wind, or ice. It is greatest in areas of little or no surface vegetation, such as deserts, where sand dunes may form."

Under the glacier, roches moutonnées (eroded outcrops of hard rock) and drumlins (rounded mounds of rock and clay) are left behind on the valley floor.

In each case, atoms or groups of atoms rearrange, making new substances (products) from the original ones (reactants). Reactions happen naturally, or can be made to happen; they may take years, or only an instant. Some of the main types are shown here. A reaction usually involves a change in energy (see pp. 314-315). In a burning reaction, for example, the making of new bonds between atoms releases energy as heat and light. This type of reaction, in which heat is given off, is an exothermic reaction. Many reactions, like burning, are irreversible, but some can take place in either direction, and are said to be reversible. Reactions can be used to form solids from solutions: in a double decomposition reaction, two compounds in solution break down and re-form into two new substances, often creating a precipitate (insoluble solid); in displacement, an element (e.g., copper) displaces another element (e.g., silver) from a solution. The rate (speed) of a reaction is determined by many different factors, such as temperature, and the size and shape of the reactants.

                        "content": "LIGHT IS A FORM OF ENERGY. It is a type of electromagnetic radiation, like X- rays or radio waves. All electromagnetic radiation is produced by electric charges (see pp. 316-317): it is caused by the effects of oscillating electric and magnetic fields as they travel through space. Electromagnetic radiation is considered to have both wave and particle properties. It can be thought of as a wave of electricity and magnetism. In that case, the difference between the various forms of radiation is their wavelength. Radiation can also be said to consist of particles, or packets of energy, called photons. The difference between light and X-rays, for instance, is the amount of energy that each photon carries. The complete range of radiation is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum, extending from low energy, long wavelength radio waves to high energy, short wavelength gamma rays. Light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible. White light from the Sun is made up of all the visible wavelengths of radiation, which can be seen when it is separated by using a prism. Light, like all forms of electromagnetic radiation, can be reflected (bounced back) and refracted (bent). Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are produced in different ways. Sometimes visible light\u2014and infrared radiation\u2014is generated by the vibrating particles of warm or hot objects. The emission of light in this way is called incandescence. Light can also be produced by fluorescence, a phenomenon in which electrons gain and lose energy within atoms.Oscillating electric fieldWavelengthOscillating magnetic fieldDirection of travelTwo fields at right anglesPhoton thought of as wave packet of energyBlue light has about twice the energy of red lightBlue light has shorter wavelength: waves are more tightly packedRed light has long wavelengthPrism forms spectrum by bending wavelengths at different anglesGlass prismWhite lightRed light (wavelength: 6.2\u20137.7 × 10 -7m)Orange light (wavelength: 5.9\u20136.2 × 10 -7m)Yellow light (wavelength: 5.7\u20135.9 × 10 -7m)Green light (wavelength: 4.9\u20135.7 × 10 -7m)Blue light (wavelength: 4.5\u20134.9 × 10 -7m)Violet light (wavelength: 3.9\u20134.5 × 10 -7m)Long-wave radioShort-wave radioMedium-wave radioVery high-frequency (VHF) radioMicrowavesInfrared radiationRadio waves10 410 310 210110 -110 -210 -2510 -2610 -2710 -2810 -310 -2410 -410 -2310 -510 -2210 -2110 -20"

                        "content": "LIGHT IS A FORM OF ENERGY. It is a type of electromagnetic radiation, like X- rays or radio waves. All electromagnetic radiation is produced by electric charges (see pp. 316-317): it is caused by the effects of oscillating electric and magnetic fields as they travel through space. Electromagnetic radiation is considered to have both wave and particle properties. It can be thought of as a wave of electricity and magnetism. In that case, the difference between the various forms of radiation is their wavelength. Radiation can also be said to consist of particles, or packets of energy, called photons. The difference between light and X-rays, for instance, is the amount of energy that each photon carries. The complete range of radiation is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum, extending from low energy, long wavelength radio waves to high energy, short wavelength gamma rays. Light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible. White light from the Sun is made up of all the visible wavelengths of radiation, which can be seen when it is separated by using a prism. Light, like all forms of electromagnetic radiation, can be reflected (bounced back) and refracted (bent). Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are produced in different ways. Sometimes visible light\u2014and infrared radiation\u2014is generated by the vibrating particles of warm or hot objects. The emission of light in this way is called incandescence.

In Europe, electric trains developed as a more efficient alternative to the steam locomotive and diesel-electric power. Like diesels, electric trains employ electric motors to drive the wheels but, unlike diesels, the electricity is generated externally at a power station. Electric current is picked up either from a catenary (overhead cable) via a pantograph, or from a third rail.

Railroad ties are usually made of reinforced concrete, although wood and steel are still used. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is the track gauge. It evolved in Britain, which uses a gauge of 4 ft 8½ in (1,435 mm), known as the standard gauge. As engineering grew more sophisticated, narrower gauges were adopted because they cost less to build. The loading gauge, which is equally important, determines the size of the largest loaded vehicle that may pass through tunnels and under bridges with adequate clearance. Safe train operation relies on following a signaling system. At first, signaling was based on a simple time interval between trains, but it now depends on maintaining a safe distance between successive trains traveling in the same direction. Most modern signals are color lights, but older mechanical semaphore signals are still used. On the latest high-speed lines, train drivers receive control instructions by electronic means. Signaling depends on reliable control of the train by effective braking. For fast, modern trains, which have considerable momentum, it is essential that each vehicle in the train can be braked by the driver or by a train control system, such as Automatic Train Protection (ATP).

The first trolleys, like buses, were horse-drawn, but in 1881, electric streetcars appeared in Berlin, Germany. Electric streetcars soon became widespread throughout Europe and North America. Trolleys run on rails along a fixed route, using electric motors that receive power from overhead cables. As road networks developed, motorized buses offered a flexible alternative to trolleys. By the 1930s, they had replaced trolley systems in many cities. City buses typically have doors at both front and rear to make loading and unloading easier. Double-decker designs are popular, occupying the same amount of street space as single-decker buses but able to transport twice the number of people. Buses are also commonly used for inter-city travel and touring. Tour buses have reclining seats, large windows, luggage space, and toilets. Recently, as city traffic has become increasingly congested, many city planners have designed new electric streetcar routes to run alongside bus routes as part of an integrated transportation system.Trolley headTrolley boomTrolley baseUpper deckDrop windowQuarter lightBrakeStairPlatformLifeguardUnderframeTruckControllerLower deckUpper deck air intakeSquare roof domeMirror for driver to see upstairsRoute numberOperator\u2019s logoDestination screenSide mirrorSide mirrorPermit holderTurning indicatorFront bumperEntrance doorEmergency door controlTurning indicatorManufacturer\u2019s badgeLicense plateFog lightGrillHeadlightWindshield wiperSidelightAsymmetric windshield    Side mirrorDestination screenRoute informationWindow ventUpper deck windshield"

The car was developed in Germany in the 1930s by Dr. Ferdinand Porsche.

Electric cars had to stop frequently to recharge their heavy batteries, and steam cars gave smooth power delivery but were too complicated for the average driver to use. A rival power source, the internal combustion engine, was invented in 1860 by Etienne Lenoir (see pp. 334-335). This engine converted the force of a controlled explosion into rotary motion, to turn the wheels of a vehicle. Early variations on this basic model included sleeve valves, separately cast cylinders, and the two-stroke combustion cycle. Today, many internal combustion engines, including the Wankel rotary and diesels (see pp. 346-347), use the four-stroke cycle, first demonstrated by Nikolaus Otto in 1876.

The object is to lower harmful emissions and conserve natural resources. One of the alternatives already in production is the hybrid car. A hybrid vehicle uses two or more fuels. Examples include diesel-electric trains and mopeds. The latter combine the power of a gasoline engine with pedal power. In a hybrid car, gas consumption is reduced by the provision of additional power by an electric motor during acceleration. The motor is driven by power from on-board batteries that are recharged by an engine-driven generator when the car is decelerating or cruising. Some hybrid cars transfer energy from the wheels to a flywheel during braking. The flywheel drives the generator, which recharges the batteries.WindshieldAntennaAerodynamic roofSide mirrorPlastic bumperAerodynamic underside componentsCooling intakeAluminum hoodIgnition coilsRocker coverDipstickIgnition coilsWater pumpCrankshaft pulleyDrive beltAir-conditioning compressorBelt tensionerEngine drive beltAir-conditioning compressorOil filterLightweight magnesium alloy oil sump panLightweight plastic intake manifoldElectric motor housingCoolant pipeMotor power cablesAir-intake ductPlastic front wingsFront air dam"

In a hybrid car, gas consumption is reduced by the provision of additional power by an electric motor during acceleration. The motor is driven by power from on-board batteries that are recharged by an engine-driven generator when the car is decelerating or cruising. Some hybrid cars transfer energy from the wheels to a flywheel during braking. The flywheel drives the generator, which recharges the batteries."

While a touring bike resembles the racing bike in many respects, it is designed for comfort and stability on long-distance journeys.

Consisting of the frame, wheels, suspension, and brakes, the chassis performs various functions. The frame, which is built from steel or alloy, keeps the wheels in line to maintain the handling of the motorcycle, and serves as a structure for mounting other components. The engine and gearbox unit is bolted into place, while items such as the seat,  the fenders, and the fairing are more easily removable. Suspension cushions the rider from irregularities in the road surface. In most suspension systems, coil springs controlled by an oil damper separate the main mass of the motorcycle from the wheels. At the front, the spring and damper are usually incorporated in a telescopic fork; the rear employs a pivoted swingarm. The suspension also helps to retain maximum contact between the tires and the road, necessary for effective braking and steering. Drum brakes were common until the 1970s, but modern motorcycles use disc brakes, which are more powerful.Shock absorber"

Races take place on roads or tracks or \u201coff-road,\u201d in fields, dirt tracks, and even the desert. \u201cGrand Prix\u201d world championships in road-racing are contested by three classes: 125cc, 250cc two-strokes; the top class of 500cc two-strokes; and 900cc four-stroke machines. The latest racing sidecars have more in common with racing cars than motorcycles. The rider and passenger operate within an all-enclosing, aerodynamic fairing. The Suzuki RGV500 shown here, like other Grand Prix machines, carries advertising, which helps to cover the cost of developing motorcycle technology.  In Speedway, which originated in the US in 1902, motorcycles operate without brakes or  a gearbox. Off-road competition motorcycles have less emphasis on high power output. In Motocross, for example, which is held on rough terrain, they must have high ground clearance, flexible long-travel suspension, and tires with a chunky tread pattern."

Races take place on roads or tracks or \u201coff-road,\u201d in fields, dirt tracks, and even the desert. \u201cGrand Prix\u201d world championships in road-racing are contested by three classes: 125cc, 250cc two-strokes; the top class of 500cc two-strokes; and 900cc four-stroke machines. The latest racing sidecars have more in common with racing cars than motorcycles. The rider and passenger operate within an all-enclosing, aerodynamic fairing. The Suzuki RGV500 shown here, like other Grand Prix machines, carries advertising, which helps to cover the cost of developing motorcycle technology.  In Speedway, which originated in the US in 1902, motorcycles operate without brakes or  a gearbox. Off-road competition motorcycles have less emphasis on high power output. In Motocross, for example, which is held on rough terrain, they must have high ground clearance, flexible long-travel suspension, and tires with a chunky tread pattern."

A longship had one row of oars on each side and a single sail. The hull had clinker (overlapping) planks. Prowheads adorned fighting ships during campaigns of war. The sailing longship was also used for local coastal travel. The karv below was probably built as transport for an important family, while the smaller faering (top right) was a rowing boat only.

These could fire in any direction, could be loaded from the breech very rapidly, and, instead of cannonballs, they discharged exploding shells. Modern fighting ships, like the frigate, combine heavy ship-borne armament with light helicopter weaponry. Submarines function below the surface of the sea.

These could fire in any direction, could be loaded from the breech very rapidly, and, instead of cannonballs, they discharged exploding shells. Modern fighting ships, like the frigate, combine heavy ship-borne armament with light helicopter weaponry. Submarines function below the surface of the sea. Their speed and ability to fire missiles from under water are their major assets.

The principal disadvantage of this arrangement in early, wooden-framed aircraft was that single wings were weak and required strong wires to brace them to king posts above and below the fuselage. However, single wings also had advantages: they experienced less drag than multiple wings, allowing greater speed; they also made aircraft more manoeuvrable because single wings were easier to warp (twist) than double wings, and warping the wings was how pilots controlled the roll of early aircraft. By 1912, the French pilot Louis Blériot had used a monoplane to make the first flight across the English Channel, and the Briton Robert Blackburn and the Frenchman Armand Deperdussin had proved the greater speed of monoplanes. However, a spate of crashes caused by broken wings discouraged monoplane production, except in Germany, where all-metal monoplanes were developed in 1917. The wings of all-metal monoplanes did not need strengthening by struts or bracing wires, but despite this, such planes were not widely adopted until the 1930s.Taut fabricCarved wooden propellerKing postNose-ringHub bolted to propellerPilot\u2019s viewing apertureExhaust valve push-rodElevator hingeLanding gear rear cross-memberWheel fairingRubber-sprung wheelLanding gear front strutTailskidAxleLanding gear rear strutLanding skidElevatorGnome seven-cylinder rotary engine"

                        "content": "MONOPLANES HAVE ONE WING on each side of the fuselage. The principal disadvantage of this arrangement in early, wooden-framed aircraft was that single wings were weak and required strong wires to brace them to king posts above and below the fuselage. However, single wings also had advantages: they experienced less drag than multiple wings, allowing greater speed; they also made aircraft more manoeuvrable because single wings were easier to warp (twist) than double wings, and warping the wings was how pilots controlled the roll of early aircraft. By 1912, the French pilot Louis Blériot had used a monoplane to make the first flight across the English Channel, and the Briton Robert Blackburn and the Frenchman Armand Deperdussin had proved the greater speed of monoplanes. However, a spate of crashes caused by broken wings discouraged monoplane production, except in Germany, where all-metal monoplanes were developed in 1917. The wings of all-metal monoplanes did not need strengthening by struts or bracing wires, but despite this, such planes were not widely adopted until the 1930s."

Modern piston aero-engines work on the same basic principles as the engine used by the Wright brothers in the first powered flight in 1903.

For example, modern aero-engines may use a two-stroke or a four-stroke combustion cycle; they may have from one to nine air- or water-cooled cylinders, which may be arranged horizontally, in-line, in V formation, or radially; and they may drive the aircraft\u2019s propeller either directly or through a reduction gearbox.

Compared with the first jetliners  (which were introduced in the 1940s), modern ones are much quieter, burn fuel  more efficiently, and produce less air pollution. These advances are largely due  to the replacement of turbojet engines with turbofan engines (see pp. 418-419). The greater power of turbofan engines at low speeds enables modern jetliners to carry more fuel and passengers than turbojet aircraft; a modern Boeing 747-400 (popularly known as a \u201cjumbo jet\u201d) can fly 400 people for 8,500 miles (13,700 km) without needing to refuel. Jetliners fly at high altitudes, typically cruising at 26,000-36,000 ft (8000-11,000 m),  where they can use fuel efficiently and usually avoid bad weather. The pilot always controls the aircraft during takeoff and landing, but at other times the aircraft is usually controlled by an autopilot. Autopilots are complex on-board mechanisms that detect deviations from an aircraft\u2019s route and make appropriate adjustments to the flight controls. Flight decks are also equipped with radars that warn pilots  of approaching hazards, such as mountain ranges, bad weather, and other aircraft.Shoulder cowlingHinged cowling panelNose cowlingEngine pylonFan duct nozzleCore-engine jet pipeFire-extinguisher discharge indicatorOil-filler doorPush-in door for hand-held fire-extinguisherDrain mastOil-filler door for integrated-drive generatorElectrically heated, birdproof windshieldStatic air-pressure plateVHF omni-range and instrument-landing-system antennasSide windowAnchor for open doorRain gutterForward main door apertureLight-alloy door frameMultiple-pinned lockFloor levelToilet service connectorPitot head for dynamic air pressureAnchor for open doorMain external operating handlePassenger window apertureFinger recessPeepholeHingeRadomeAir temperature probeStall  warning vane"

There are many supersonic military aircraft, but only two supersonic passenger-carrying aircraft (also called SSTs, or supersonic transports) have been produced: the Russian Tu-144, and the Concorde, produced jointly by Britain and France. The Tu-144 was withdrawn in 1978,  after only seven months in service. The Concorde remained in service from 1976 until 2003, with a break for modifications from July 2000 until October 2001. Its features included a droop nose, which lowered during takeoff and landing to aid visibility from the cockpit; the pumping of fuel between forward  and aft trim tanks helped stabilize the aircraft. The Concorde had a narrow fuselage  and short span wings to reduce drag during supersonic flight. Its noisy turbojet engines with afterburners enabled it to carry 100 passengers at a cruising speed of Mach 2 at 50,000-60,000 ft (15,000-18,000 m). Once an aircraft is flying faster than Mach 1,  it produces a continuous air-pressure wave, which is heard as a \u201csonic boom.\u201dStarboard outboard engine air-intakeInboard elevon-jack fairingNose-gear legStandby pitot headFinStrakeToiletsElectrothermal deicing panelStarboard forward trim tank           Overhead luggage binPassenger accommodationSeat attachment railUnderfloor air-conditioning ductLife raftVHF antennaWardrobeForward galleyAdditional crew\u2019s seatThird pilot\u2019s seatCockpit windshieldAluminium-alloy layers and insulationRetractable visor\u201cA\u201d frameErosion-resistant radomeLeading edgeVariable nozzleWeather radarVisor jackPivoted retractable frameDroop-nose hingeCockpit air-conditioning ductTail coneAft doorElevon (combined elevator and aileron)Hot-section steel and titanium skinEngine cowlingLanding gear doorBogie main landing gearEmergency exitDorsal finFinUpper rudderCaptain\u2019s seatStandby flight-control hydraulic jackPlug-type passenger doorNose-gear doorNose-gear leg Multi-ply high-pressure tireMachined skin panelPort forward trim tankSteering actuatorTelescopic strutLateral bracing strut"

It works by continuously burning a mixture of fuel and air in a combustion chamber to produce a jet of hot exhaust gas that is expelled through a nozzle to produce thrust. The hot gas also spins turbine blades, which, in turn, spin the blades of an air compressor; the compressor forces air into the combustion chamber. Many of the fastest aircraft use turbojets, with additional booster units called afterburners, but their use is restricted by their high noise emission. Most jetliners use turbofan jet engines, which are quieter. An enormous fan, driven by a low-pressure turbine, feeds some air into the compressor but feeds most of it through bypass ducts to join the exhaust jetstream in the tail cone. The bypass stream produces most of the thrust. Many smaller, propeller-driven aircraft use turboprop jet engines, in which the engine powers a propeller.Fuel sprayerTurbine rotorExhaust diffuserTail coneJet pipeExhaust nozzleIgniterNozzle guide vaneCombustion chamber casingAir impingement starterAlternatorNose coneAir intakeInducerCentrifugal compressorRadial diffuserReverse-flow combustion chamberPlenum ring for hot anti-icing airFlow splitterGearbox bevel driveIntegral oil tankHigh-pressure compressorFuel manifoldFuel nozzleCentrifugal compressorHigh-pressure turbineCombustion chamberTemperature and pressure sensorLow-pressure fanInlet cone (rotating spinner)Pressure lineFan case with special structure to contain broken fanElectronic engine control and airframe interface connectorElectronic engine control (EEC) unitCompressor front bearingEngine front  mountElectrical wiring harnessFuel and oil heat exchangerOil filterCompressor air-bleed connectionFan duct"

His machine had unpowered blades above the fuselage that relied on the flow of air to rotate them and provide lift as the autogiro was driven forward by a conventional propeller. Then, in 1939, the Russian-born American Igor Sikorsky produced his VS-300, the forerunner of modern helicopters. Its engine-driven blades provided lift, propulsion, and steering. It could take off vertically, hover, and fly in any direction, and had a tail rotor to prevent the helicopter body from spinning. The introduction of gas turbine jet engines to helicopters in 1955 produced quieter, safer, and more powerful machines. Because of their versatility in flight, helicopters are today used for many purposes, including crop spraying, traffic surveillance, and transporting crews to deep-sea oil rigs, as well as acting as gunships, air ambulances, and air taxis.Blade counterweightDroop stopMain rotor hubBlade-root attachmentStabilizer-bar weightProtective gaiterFuel tank cradleExhaust pipeTail-rotor drive shaftAir intake pipeElectric fuel pumpMain rotor mastFuel vent pipeFuel tankDirect-vision panelFrameless plastic canopyRadioInstrument panelCyclic-pitch leverBatteryBattery overspillElectrical inverterPitot headAnti-collision beaconLanding lightLanding skidVHF omni-range antennaVentilatorCollective-pitch leverNavigation lightElectric power socketRiveted light-alloy forward fuselage sectionLycoming six-cylinder engineGround handling wheelValve-rocker coverAir filterCarburetor hot-air intake pipeOil tankBreather pipe"

Unpowered but with a large wingspan (up to about 82 ft, or 25 m), gliders use currents of hot, rising air (thermals) to stay aloft, and a rudder, elevators, and ailerons for control.  Modern gliders have achieved flights of more than 900 miles (1,450 km) and altitudes above 49,000 ft (15,000 m). Hang-gliders consist of a simple frame across which rigid or flexible material is stretched to form the wings. The pilot is suspended below the wings in a harness or body bag and, gripping a triangular A-frame, steers by shifting weight from side to side. Like gliders, hang-gliders rely on thermals for lift. Ultralights are basically powered hang-gliders. A small engine and an open fiberglass car (trike), which can hold a crew of two, are suspended beneath a stronger version of a hang-glider frame; the frame may have rigid or flexible wings. Ultralight pilots, like hang-glider pilots, steer by shifting their weight against an A-frame. Ultralights can reach speeds of up to 100 mph (160 kph).Grommet for front pylon strutInstrument panelApexApex wireKing postStiffening ribCenter-line beamMain suspensionRear-mounted propeller (pusher propeller) Fuel tankSpat (wheel fairing)Main wheelTrike nacelleEnd of ribFixed nose wheelNose-gear mountNose shellTrailing edgeDacron skinDown-turned wingtip acts as skidAileronRadio antennaAluminum air brakeBody bagSingle pilot cockpitNonretractable main wheelFuselage of fiberglass and foam layersTowing hook Forward-opening canopyShoulder padArmholeCamera pouchTailwheelRudderT-type cantilevered finHinged elevatorTailplaneShoulder strapClip-in latch for pilotLayers of insulating fabricNose wheel"

                        "content": "MODERN GLIDERS ARE AMONG the most graceful and aerodynamically efficient of all aircraft. Unpowered but with a large wingspan (up to about 82 ft, or 25 m), gliders use currents of hot, rising air (thermals) to stay aloft, and a rudder, elevators, and ailerons for control.  Modern gliders have achieved flights of more than 900 miles (1,450 km) and altitudes above 49,000 ft (15,000 m). Hang-gliders consist of a simple frame across which rigid or flexible material is stretched to form the wings. The pilot is suspended below the wings in a harness or body bag and, gripping a triangular A-frame, steers by shifting weight from side to side. Like gliders, hang-gliders rely on thermals for lift. Ultralights are basically powered hang-gliders. A small engine and an open fiberglass car (trike), which can hold a crew of two, are suspended beneath a stronger version of a hang-glider frame; the frame may have rigid or flexible wings. Ultralight pilots, like hang-glider pilots, steer by shifting their weight against an A-frame. Ultralights can reach speeds of up to 100 mph (160 kph)."

Pastels can be applied directly to any support (surface) with sufficient tooth (texture). When a pastel is drawn over a textured surface, the pigment crumbles and lodges in the fibers of the support. Pastel marks have a particular soft, matte quality and are suitable for techniques such as blending, scumbling, and feathering. Blending is a technique of rubbing and fusing two or more colors on the support using fingers or various tools such as tortillons (paper stumps), soft hair brushes, putty erasers, and soft bread. Scumbling is a technique of building up layers of pastel colors. The side or blunted tip of a soft pastel is lightly drawn over an underpainted area so that patches of the color beneath show through. Feathering is a technique of applying parallel strokes of color with the point of a pastel, usually over an existing layer of pastel color.

The essential materials needed to practice calligraphy are a writing tool, ink, and a writing surface. Quills are among the oldest writing tools. They are usually made from goose or turkey feathers, and are noted for their flexibility and ability to produce fine lines. A quill point, however, is not very durable and constant recutting and trimming is required. The most commonly used writing instrument in Western calligraphy is a detachable, metal nib held in a penholder. The metal nib is very durable, and there are a wide range of different types. Particular types of nibs\u2014such as copperplate, speedball, and round-hand nibs\u2014are used for specific styles of lettering. Some nibs have integral ink reservoirs and others have reservoirs that are detachable. Brushes are also used for writing, and for filling in outlined letters and painting decoration. Other writing tools used in calligraphy are fountain pens, felt-tip pens, rotring pens, and reed pens. Calligraphy inks may come in liquid form, or as a solid ink stick. Ink sticks are ground down in distilled water to form a liquid ink. The most common writing surfaces for calligraphy are good quality, smooth -surfaced papers. To achieve the best writing position, the calligrapher places the paper on a drawing board set at an angle.

                        "content": "CALLIGRAPHY IS BEAUTIFULLY FORMED LETTERING. The term applies to written text and illumination (the decoration of manuscripts using gold leaf and color). The essential materials needed to practice calligraphy are a writing tool, ink, and a writing surface. Quills are among the oldest writing tools. They are usually made from goose or turkey feathers, and are noted for their flexibility and ability to produce fine lines. A quill point, however, is not very durable and constant recutting and trimming is required. The most commonly used writing instrument in Western calligraphy is a detachable, metal nib held in a penholder. The metal nib is very durable, and there are a wide range of different types. Particular types of nibs\u2014such as copperplate, speedball, and round-hand nibs\u2014are used for specific styles of lettering. Some nibs have integral ink reservoirs and others have reservoirs that are detachable. Brushes are also used for writing, and for filling in outlined letters and painting decoration. Other writing tools used in calligraphy are fountain pens, felt-tip pens, rotring pens, and reed pens. Calligraphy inks may come in liquid form, or as a solid ink stick. Ink sticks are ground down in distilled water to form a liquid ink. The most common writing surfaces for calligraphy are good quality, smooth -surfaced papers. To achieve the best writing position, the calligrapher places the paper on a drawing board set at an angle. "

In intaglio printing, lines are engraved or etched into the surface of a metal plate. Lines are engraved by hand using sharp metal tools. They are etched by corroding the metal plate with acid, using acid-resistant ground to protect the areas not to be etched. The plate is then inked and wiped, leaving the grooves filled with ink and the surface clean. Dampened paper is laid  over the plate, and both paper and plate are passed through the rollers of an etching press. The pressure of the rollers forces the paper into the grooves, so that it takes up the ink, leaving an impression on the paper. Lithographic printing is based on the antipathy between grease and water. An image is drawn on a surface\u2014usually a stone or metal plate\u2014with a greasy medium, such as tusche (lihographic ink). The greasy drawing is fixed on to the plate by applying an acidic solution, such as gum arabic. The surface is then dampened and rolled with ink. The ink adheres only to the greasy areas and is repelled by the water. Paper is laid on the plate and pressure is applied by means of a press. In relief printing, the nonprinting areas of a wood or linoleum block are cut away using gouges, knives, and other tools. The printing areas are left raised in relief and are rolled with ink. Paper is laid on the inked block and pressure is applied by means of a press  or by burnishing (rubbing) the back of the paper. The  most common forms of relief printing are woodcut, wood engraving, and linocut. In screen printing, the printing surface is a mesh stretched across a wooden  frame. A stencil is applied to the mesh  to seal the non printing areas and ink  is scraped through the mesh to  produce an image.PaperPrinted imageEngraved or etched imageInked areaPrinted imageMetal plateDamp surface rejects inkPaperImage  drawn on stone with greasy mediumInk adheres to greasy imagePaperPrinted imageInked surfaceRaised figureWood blockWooden frameStencilPrinted imageInk forced through meshPaper"

Vitreous glass is cut into pieces using a pair of pliers. Mosaics can be made using a direct or indirect method. In the direct method, the tesserae are laid directly into a bed of cement-based adhesive. In the indirect method, the design is drawn in reverse on paper or cloth.

Adhesive is spread with a trowel on to a solid surface\u2014such as a wall\u2014and the back of the mosaic is laid into the adhesive. Finally, the paper or cloth is soaked off to reveal the mosaic.

A carved sculpture is made by cutting away the surplus from a block of hard material such as stone, marble, or wood. The tools used for carving vary according to the material being carved. Heavy steel points, claws, and chisels that are struck with  a lump hammer are generally used for stone and marble. Sharp gouges and chisels that are struck with a wooden mallet are used for wood. Sculptures formed from  hard materials are generally finished by filing with rasps, rifflers, and other abrasive implements. Modeling is a process by which shapes are built up, using malleable materials such as clay, plaster, and wax. The material is cut with wire-ended tools and modeled with the fingers or a variety of hardwood and metal implements. For large or intricate modeled sculptures an armature (frame), made from metal or wood, is used to provide internal support. Sculptures formed in soft materials  may harden naturally or can be made more durable by firing in a kiln. Modeled sculptures are often first designed in wax or another material to be cast later in a metal (see pp. 454-455) such as bronze. The development of many new materials in the 20th century has enabled sculptors to experiment with new techniques such as construction (joining preformed pieces of material such as machine components, mirrors, and furniture) and kinetic (mobile) sculpture. 2½ lb (1.1 kg) iron headAsh handleCurved legStone for sharpening wood-carving toolsCedar boxSurface for sharpening stone-carving toolsGap measures distance between two points on a sculptureWing nut"

Egyptian temples were often huge and geometric, like the Temple of Amon-Re (below and right). They were usually decorated with hieroglyphs (sacred characters used for picture-writing) and painted reliefs depicting gods, Pharaohs (kings), and queens. Tombs were particularly important to the Egyptians, who believed that the dead were resurrected in the afterlife. The tombs were often decorated\u2014as, for example, the surround of the false door opposite\u2014in order to give comfort to the dead. The best-known ancient Egyptian tombs are the pyramids, which were designed to symbolize the rays of the Sun. Many of the architectural forms used by the ancient Egyptians were later adopted by other civilizations; for example, columns and capitals were later used by the ancient Greeks (see pp. 460-461) and ancient Romans (see pp. 462-465).Side aisleHorus, the Sun-god"

                        "content": "THE CIVILIZATION OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS (which lasted from about 3100 bc until it was finally absorbed into the Roman Empire in 30 bc) is famous for its temples and tombs. Egyptian temples were often huge and geometric, like the Temple of Amon-Re (below and right). They were usually decorated with hieroglyphs (sacred characters used for picture-writing) and painted reliefs depicting gods, Pharaohs (kings), and queens. Tombs were particularly important to the Egyptians, who believed that the dead were resurrected in the afterlife. The tombs were often decorated\u2014as, for example, the surround of the false door opposite\u2014in order to give comfort to the dead. The best-known ancient Egyptian tombs are the pyramids, which were designed to symbolize the rays of the Sun. Many of the architectural forms used by the ancient Egyptians were later adopted by other civilizations; for example, columns and capitals were later used by the ancient Greeks (see pp. 460-461) and ancient Romans (see pp. 462-465)."

Typical Gothic buildings include the Cathedrals of Salisbury and old St. Paul\u2019s in England, and Notre Dame de Paris in France (see pp. 472-473). The Gothic style developed out of Romanesque architecture in France (see pp. 468-469) in the mid- 12th century, and then spread throughout Europe. The decorative elements of Gothic architecture became highly developed in buildings of the English Decorated style (late 13th-14th century) and the French Flamboyant style (15th-16th century). These styles are exemplified by the tower of Salisbury Cathedral and the staircase in the Church of St. Maclou (see pp. 472-473), respectively. In both of these styles, embellishments such as ballflowers and curvilinear (flowing) tracery were used liberally. The English Perpendicular style (late 14th-15th century), which followed the Decorated style, emphasized the vertical and horizontal elements of a building.

It is characterized by curved outlines and ostentatious decoration, as can be seen in the Italian church details (right). The baroque style was particularly widely favored in Italy, Spain, and Germany. It was also adopted in Britain and France, but with adaptations. The British architects Sir Christopher Wren and Nicholas Hawksmoor, for example, used baroque features\u2014such as the concave walls of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral and the curved buttresses of the Church of St. George in the East (see pp. 480-481)\u2014but they did so with restraint. Similarly, the curved buttresses and volutes of the Parisian Church of St. Paul-St. Louis are relatively plain. In the second half of  the 17th century, a distinct classical style (known as neoclassicism) developed in northern Europe as a reaction to the excesses of baroque. Typical of this new style were churches such as the Madeleine (a proposed facade is shown below), as well as secular buildings such as the Cirque Napoleon (opposite) and the buildings of the British architect Sir John Soane (see pp. 482-483). In early 18th-century France, an extremely lavish form of baroque developed, known as rococo. The balcony from Nantes (see pp. 482-483) with its twisted ironwork and head-shaped corbels is typical of this style.Attached segmental pedimentLanternParapetCorniceFinialRaking corniceFriezePanelRound-arched windowTwin pilasterCoved domeTriple keystoneAttic storyTriangular pedimentBalustradeRe-entrant entablatureComposite capitalAttached triangular pedimentBlind windowComposite columnComposite pilasterSocleDoor jambArchitraveBlind doorBaseFluted shaftVoluteIntermediate corniceFestoonRaised panelEntablatureCorniceModillion (bracket)UrnDentil ornament"

However, free-standing structures began to be built in southern India from about the eighth century AD. Many were built in the Dravidian style, like the Temple of Virupaksha (opposite) with its characteristic antarala (terraced tower), perforated windows, and numerous arches, pilasters, and carvings. The earliest Buddhist religious monuments were Indian stupas, which consisted of a single hemispherical dome surmounted by a chattravali (shaft) and surrounded by railings with ornate gates. Later Indian stupas and those built elsewhere were sometimes modified; for example, in Sri Lanka, the dome became bell-shaped, and was called a dagoba.

Both the Centre Georges Pompidou (below and opposite) and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (see pp. 498-499) are functionalist buildings: on each, elements of engineering and the building\u2019s services are clearly visible on the outside. In the 1980s, some architects rejected functionalism in favor of post-modernism, in which historical styles\u2014particularly neoclassicism\u2014were revived, using modern building materials and techniques. In many modern buildings, walls are made of glass or concrete hung from a frame, as in the Kawana House (right); this type of wall construction is known as curtain walling. Other modern construction techniques include the intricate interlocking of concrete vaults\u2014as in the Sydney Opera House (see pp. 498-499)\u2014and the use of high-tension beams to create complex roof shapes, such as the paraboloid roof of the Church of St. Pierre de Libreville (see pp. 498-499)."

The present-day conventional system of notation uses a five-line stave (staff)\u2014divided by vertical lines into sections known as bars\u2014on which notes, rests, clefs, key signatures, time signatures, accidentals, and other symbols are written. A note indicates the duration of a sound and, according to its position on the stave, its pitch. Notes can be arranged on the stave in order of pitch to form a scale. A silence in the music is indicated by a rest. The clef, which is placed at the begininng of a stave, fixes the pitch. The key signature,  which is placed after the clef, indicates the key. The time signature, placed after the key signature, shows the number of beats in a bar. Accidentals are used to indicate the raising or lowering of the pitch of a note.Moderately fast and quietTie (bind)Repeat the previous barTreble clefBass clefFour-four time (common time)Key signatureStave (staff)Alto clefTreble voiceAlto voiceTenor voiceBass voiceOrgan part for right handOrgan part for left handBass (or F) clefTreble (or G) clefAlto (or C) clefSix-eight timeThree-four timeBreveMinimQuaverSemibreveCrotchetSemiquaverBreve restMinim restQuaver restSemibreve restCrotchet restSemiquaver restSharpNaturalDouble sharpFlatDouble flatKey signatureOrgan pedal lineInstruments of the orchestra written in ItalianBar lineBass clefBarCrotchet"

The tube may be wide or narrow, mainly conical, as in the horn and tuba, or mainly cylindrical, as in the trumpet and trombone. The sound of a brass instrument is made by the player\u2019s lips vibrating against the mouthpiece, so that the air vibrates in the tube. By changing lip tension, the player can vary the vibrations and produce notes of different pitches. The range of notes produced by a brass instrument can be extended by means of a valve system. Most brass instruments, such as the trumpet, have piston valves that divert the air in the instrument along an extra piece of tubing (known as a valve slide) when pressed down. The total length of the tube is increased and the pitch of the note produced is lowered. Instead of valves, the trombone has a movable slide that can be pushed away from or drawn toward the player.

This may be done by drawing a bow across the strings, as in the violin; or by plucking the strings, as in the harp and guitar (see pp. 512-513). The four modern members of the bowed string family are the violin, viola, cello (violoncello), and double bass. Each consists of a hollow, wooden body, a long neck, and four strings. The bow is a wooden stick with horsehair stretched across its length. The vibrations made by drawing the bow across the strings are transmitted to the hollow body, and this itself vibrates, amplifying and enriching the sound produced. The harp consists of a set of strings of different lengths stretched across a wooden frame. The strings are plucked by the player\u2019s thumbs and fingers\u2014except the little finger of each hand\u2014which produces vibrations that are amplified by the harp\u2019s sound board. The pitch of the note produced by any stringed instrument depends on the length, weight, and tension of the string.

The organ consists of pipes that are operated by one or more manuals (keyboards) and a pedal board. The pipes are lined up in rows (known as ranks or registers) on top of a wind chest. The sound of the organ is made when air is admitted into a pipe by pressing a key or pedal. The piano consists of wire strings stretched over a metal frame, and a keyboard and pedals that operate hammers and dampers. The piano frame is either vertical\u2014as in the upright piano\u2014or horizontal\u2014as in the grand piano. When a key is at rest, a damper lies against the string to stop it from vibrating.

Drums are played in most parts of the world and are made in a number of different shapes and sizes. They can be divided into three groups according to the shape of the body-shell: frame drums (e.g., tambourines), bowl-shaped drums (e.g., timpani), and tubular drums (e.g., congas). Drums are usually sounded by striking the drumhead with the hands or with beaters, such as a hard-headed stick. The drumhead vibrates, and its vibrations are amplified by the hollow body shell. The snare drum has wires\u2014known as snares\u2014stretched across the lower drumhead; the snares vibrate against the lower drumhead when the drum is played. Most drums, such as congas, do not have a definite pitch and can play only rhythms (see pp. 516-517). Other drums, such as timpani, have a definite pitch and can play melody, harmony, and rhythms. They can be tuned by adjusting the tension of the drumhead. Different types of drum can be combined together with other percussion instruments to form a drum set. The basic components of the drum set are bass drum, tom-toms, floor tom (tenor drum), snare drum, and cymbals.Crash cymbalTension keyTension rodTom-tomSnare drumTripod standAdjustable damperTransparent lower drumheadChainTension screwFelt-coveredbeaterPedalPedalSnareStickSnare release leverUpper drumheadLugSnare mountingLugHi-hat cymbal"

Soccer, officially termed association football, is a team sport in which players attempt to score goals by passing and dribbling the ball down the field past opposing defenders, and kicking or heading the ball into the goal net, outwitting the defending goalkeeper. Each team consists of 10 outfield players (defenders, midfielders, and strikers) and a goalkeeper. Players from the opposing team may challenge the player in possession of the ball, but an illegal or foul tackle results in a penalty if a foul occurs inside the penalty area or a free kick if outside the penalty area.

The object of the game is to take possession of the ball and score points by throwing the ball into the opposing team\u2019s basket. A player moves the ball up and down the court by bouncing it along the ground or \u201cdribbling\u201d; the ball may be passed between players by throwing, bouncing, or rolling. Players may not run with or kick the ball, although pivoting on one foot is allowed. The game begins with the referee throwing the ball into the air and a player from each team jumping up to try and \u201ctip\u201d the ball to a teammate. The length of the game and the number of periods played varies at different levels. There are amateur, professional, and international rules. No game ends in a draw. An extra period of five minutes is played, plus as many extra periods as are necessary to break the tie. In addition to the five players on court, each team has up to seven substitutes, but players may only leave the court with the permission of the referee. Basketball is a noncontact sport and fouls on other players are penalized by a throw-in awarded against the offending team; a free throw at the basket is awarded when a player is fouled in the act of shooting. Basketball is a fast-moving game, requiring both physical and mental coordination. Skillful tactical play matters more than simple physical strength and the agility of the players makes the game an excellent spectator sport.BackboardMetal rimCord net6 ft (1.8 m)BackboardEnd-lineRestraining circlePlayer\u2019s benchRefereeTimekeeperClock operatorScorerRefereeRight forwardThree-point line49 ft (15 m)SidelineFree-throw lineCenter circleLeft forwardCenterlineCenterLeft guardRight guardSemicircleBasket10 ft  (3.05 m)"

In volleyball, the object of the game is to hit the ball over a net strung across the center of the court so that it touches the ground on the opponent\u2019s side. The team of six players can take three hits to direct the ball over the net, although the same player cannot hit the ball twice in a row. Players can hit the  ball with their arms, hands, or any other part of their upper body. Teams score points only while serving. The first team to score 15 points, with a two- point margin over their opponent, wins the game. Netball is one of the few sports played exclusively by women. Similar to basketball (see  pp. 532\u2013533), it is played on a slightly larger court with seven players instead of five. A team moves the ball toward the goal by throwing, passing, and catching it with the aim of throwing the ball through the opponents\u2019 goal net. Players are confined by their playing position to specific areas of the court. Team handball is one of the world\u2019s fastest games. Each side has seven players. A team moves the ball by dribbling, passing, or bouncing it as they run. Players may stop, catch, throw, bounce, or strike the ball with any part of the body above the knees. Each team tries to score goals by directing the ball past the opposition\u2019s goalkeeper into the net, which is similar to a soccer net.Team colorsRibbed cuffEndlineLinesman29 ft 6 in (9 m)SidelinePlayers\u2019 benchRefereeScorerNetLeftforwardBackzoneLeft backLinesmanLinesmanClear spaceAttack zoneAttack lineUmpireCenter forwardRight forwardCenter backCotton-knit jerseyLeather covering8¼ in(21 cm)Elasticated waistShortsElasticated knit fabricInjected molded paddingMen\u2019s: 8 ft (2.4 m)Women\u2019s: 7 ft 4 in  (2.2 m)AntennaTapeNetPostLinesmanService areaServer"

Early forms of these games include hurling, shinty, bandy, and pelota. Field hockey is played by men and women: two teams of 11 players try to gain and keep possession of the ball and score goals by using the hockey stick to propel the ball into their opponents\u2019 goal net. Skills such as passing, pushing, or hitting the ball by slapping or lifting it in a flicking movement, and shooting at goal are crucial. Hockey is played indoors and outdoors on grass or synthetic fields. Lacrosse is played internationally as a 12-a-side game for women and as 10-a-side game for men. The women\u2019s field has no absolute boundaries but the men\u2019s field has clearly defined side-lines and end-lines. The ball is kept in play by being carried, thrown, or batted with the crosse, and rolled or kicked in any direction. In men\u2019s and women\u2019s lacrosse, play can continue behind the marked goal areas. Similar skills are required in hurling\u2014a Gaelic field game played on the same field as Gaelic football (see pp. 528\u2013529), using the same goalposts and net. In hurling, the ball may be struck with or carried on the hurley and, when off the ground, may be struck with the hand or kicked. Goals (three points) are scored when the ball passes between the posts and under the crossbar; one point is scored when it passes between the posts and over the crossbar.Air ventHard shellFace maskStrapRigid palmPadded wristSteam-bent ash headBladeStitched seam2¾\u20133 in (7\u20137.5 cm)Padding protects toes against the hard ballProtective overshoeStrap7 ft  (2.1 m)180 ft  (55 m)GoalkeeperLeft backLeft halfCenter halfUmpireLeft wingInside leftGoal-lineFive yard markPenalty spotGoalShooting circleCorner flagSide-lineCenter forwardInside right3 ft (91 cm)Right wingRight halfRight backTapeHandle"

Early forms of these games include hurling, shinty, bandy, and pelota. Field hockey is played by men and women: two teams of 11 players try to gain and keep possession of the ball and score goals by using the hockey stick to propel the ball into their opponents\u2019 goal net. Skills such as passing, pushing, or hitting the ball by slapping or lifting it in a flicking movement, and shooting at goal are crucial. Hockey is played indoors and outdoors on grass or synthetic fields. Lacrosse is played internationally as a 12-a-side game for women and as 10-a-side game for men. The women\u2019s field has no absolute boundaries but the men\u2019s field has clearly defined side-lines and end-lines. The ball is kept in play by being carried, thrown, or batted with the crosse, and rolled or kicked in any direction. In men\u2019s and women\u2019s lacrosse, play can continue behind the marked goal areas. Similar skills are required in hurling\u2014a Gaelic field game played on the same field as Gaelic football (see pp. 528\u2013529), using the same goalposts and net. In hurling, the ball may be struck with or carried on the hurley and, when off the ground, may be struck with the hand or kicked. Goals (three points) are scored when the ball passes between the posts and under the crossbar; one point is scored when it passes between the posts and over the crossbar."

Racket strings are usually synthetic, although natural gut is still used. Tennis is played on a court divided  by a low net. Opposing players serve alternate games. At least six games must be won to gain a set, and two or sometimes three sets are needed to win a match. Tennis courts may be concrete, grass, clay, or synthetic, each surface requiring a different style of play. Badminton is an indoor sport that is played with light, flexible rackets and a birdie on a court with a high net. Players can score points only on their serve. The first to reach 15 points (11 points for women\u2019s singles) wins the game. Two games are needed to win a match. Squash and racketball are both played in enclosed courts. One player hits the ball against the front wall, and the other tries to return it before it bounces on the floor more than once. Squash rackets have smaller, rounder heads and stiffer frames than badminton rackets. In the United States, the game is played on a narrower court than an international court using a much harder ball. Squash games are played to 15 points (American) or 9 points (international). In racketball, players use a ball that is larger and bouncier than a squash ball. The racket is thick and sturdy, with a large head, short handle, and a thong that loops around the wrist. Points can  be won only when serving, and the first player to reach 21 points wins.LinesmanBase lineSingles sidelineReceiverCenter markCenter service lineUmpireDoubles sidelineLeft service courtServerService judgeService lineNet judgeNetRight service courtAlleyFoot-fault judgeSupporting postNetCenter strapWhite tapeSockTennis shoeMixed wool and man-made fiber coveringTennis skirtTwo halves bonded togetherStitchless seam3 ft 6 in (1.1 m)Bright colors for visibilityVulcanized rubberWristbandRacketHeadbandTennis shirtTennis ballButtGripThroatLogoFrameSynthetic stringHead36 ft (11 m)"

In the United States, the game is played on a narrower court than an international court using a much harder ball. Squash games are played to 15 points (American) or 9 points (international). In racketball, players use a ball that is larger and bouncier than a squash ball. The racket is thick and sturdy, with a large head, short handle, and a thong that loops around the wrist. Points can  be won only when serving, and the first player to reach 21 points wins."

The closer the shot is to the center of the target, the higher the score. The individual scores are added up, and the archer with the highest total wins the competition. Crossbows are used in match competitions  over 33 ft (10 m), and 100 ft (30 m). Rifle shooting is divided into three categories: smallbore, bigbore, and air rifle. Contests take place over a variety of distances and further subdivisions are based on the type of shooting position used: prone, kneeling, or standing. The Olympic  biathlon combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting over a course of approximately 12½ miles (20 km). Additional magazines of ammunition  are carried in the butt of the rifles. Bigbore rifles fitted with a telescopic sight can be used for hunting and running game target shooting. Pistol shooting events, using rapid-fire pistols, target pistols, and air pistols, take place over  33 ft (10 m), 82 ft (25 m), and 165 ft (50 m) distances.

Competitors wear crash helmets, one-piece Lycra suits, and long skis with flattened tips to minimize air resistance. Slalom and giant slalom skiiers negotiate a twisting course requiring balance, agility, and quick reactions. Courses are defined by pairs of gates. Racers must pass through each pair of gates to complete the course successfully. Competitors are timed on two runs over different courses, and the skier who completes the courses in the shortest time wins. The equipment and protective guards used by slalom skiiers are shown opposite. In Super-G races, competitors ski a single run that combines the technical challenge of slalom with the speed of downhill. The course requires skiers to complete medium-to-long radius turns at high speed, and contain up to two jumps.

Showjumping, however, is a much more recent innovation, and the first competitions were held at the beginning of the 1900s. In this sport, horse and rider must negotiate a course of variable, unfixed obstacles, making as few mistakes as possible. Showjumping fences consist of wooden stands, known as standards or wings, that support planks or poles. Parts of the fence are designed to collapse on impact, preventing injury to the horse and rider. Judges penalize competitors for errors, such as knocking down obstacles, refusing jumps, or deviating from the course. Depending on the type  of competition, the rider with the fewest faults, most points, or fastest time wins. There are two basic forms of horse racing\u2014flat races and races with jumps, such as steeplechase or hurdle races. Thoroughbred horses are used in this sport, since they have great strength and stamina and can achieve speeds of up to 40 mph (65 kph). Jockeys wear \u201csilks\u201d\u2014caps and jackets designed in distinctive colors and patterns that help identify the horses. In harness racing, the horse is driven from a light, two -wheeled carriage called a sulky. Horses are trained to trot and to pace, and different races are held for each of these types of gait. In pacing races, the horses wear hobbles to prevent them from breaking into a trot or gallop.

There are several different types of angling: freshwater coarse angling, for members of the carp family and pike; freshwater game angling, for salmon and trout; and sea angling, for sea fish such as flatfish, bass, and mackerel. Anglers use a variety of methods for catching fish. These include bait fishing, in which bait (food to allure the fish) is placed on a hook and cast into the water; fly fishing, in which a natural or artificial fly is used to lure the fish; and spinning, in which a lure that looks like a small fish revolves as it is pulled through the water. The angler uses the rod, reel, and line to cast the lure over the water. The reel controls the line as it spills off the spool and as it is wound back. Weights may be fixed to the line so that it will sink. Swivels are attached to prevent the line from twisting. When a fish bites, the hook must become embedded in its mouth and remain there while the catch is reeled in.Spool-release buttonReel foot (reel scoop)Plate-nutMechanical brakeCentrifugal brakeHandleStar dragLevel-wind systemReel foot (reel scoop)Click mechanismSide plateSpoolLineUnskirted spoolTension nut (drag adjustment)HandleRatchet (antireverse device)Bail armReelHandgripBarbPointBendThroatGapeShankEyeCheck springCheck pawlCheck pawl coverCheck slideRetaining screwGear retainerDisk springDual click gearDrag washerDisk dragDrag spindleHandgripKeeper ring"

The first of these was the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which offered features including an address book, calendar, and notepad. In recent years, PDAs have been overtaken by smartphones with internet and email access (see pp. 588\u2013589). A related product is the e-book reader, which stores books in digital form and uses \u201celectronic paper\u201d to mimic the appearance of ink on real paper. An e-book reader no bigger than a thin paperback can store several thousand digital books in its memory. The most recent small computing device is the handheld computer. This looks like a thin flat display, but it is actually a complete computer. Handheld computers are typically controlled by a touch-sensitive screen and have a wireless link to other computers and the internet. They run software applications, or apps, downloaded from the internet. The most popular handheld computer currently is the Apple iPad. It has a multitouch interface that enables its screen to detect the movements of fingertips. In addition to selecting options and apps by touching the screen, images can be enlarged or shrunk by moving fingertips apart or together on the screen.Fingers alter the electric field around nearby sections of the gridUser touches clear protective screenTouchscreeen electronics interpret the outputs from the grid to work out exactly where the fingers areLCD with buttons displayedTouch data is sent as a list of finger positions to the controller where the information is used to zoom in and out of a  web pageControllerSleep/wake buttonHome buttonApp iconJoystick controllerPrevious page buttonNext page button6-in (15-cm) screen"

                        "content": "BY THE EARLY 1990s electronic circuitry had been miniaturized to such an extent that it was possible to make small handheld computing devices. The first of these was the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which offered features including an address book, calendar, and notepad. In recent years, PDAs have been overtaken by smartphones with internet and email access (see pp. 588\u2013589). A related product is the e-book reader, which stores books in digital form and uses \u201celectronic paper\u201d to mimic the appearance of ink on real paper. An e-book reader no bigger than a thin paperback can store several thousand digital books in its memory. The most recent small computing device is the handheld computer. This looks like a thin flat display, but it is actually a complete computer. Handheld computers are typically controlled by a touch-sensitive screen and have a wireless link to other computers and the internet. They run software applications, or apps, downloaded from the internet. The most popular handheld computer currently is the Apple iPad. It has a multitouch interface that enables its screen to detect the movements of fingertips. In addition to selecting options and apps by touching the screen, images can be enlarged or shrunk by moving fingertips apart or together on the screen."

Scanners work by detecting and analyzing light reflected from an opaque image, such as a photographic print.

Flatbed scanners contain a unit, called the scan head, that contains a lamp, mirrors, a lens, and an array of CCDs (Charge-Coupled Devices).

Each CCD detects the brightness of light  from a particular pixel (picture element) along a· horizontal strip and converts this data into an electric signal. For color images, the light is usually passed through red, green, and blue filters and then directed to the CCD array  so that it can be broken down  into its component colors.

Each droplet corresponds to a single pixel (picture element). Black-and-white printers use only black ink, while color printers overprint combinations of the printing colors (cyan, yellow, magenta, and black) to create a full color range. The printhead containing the nozzles moves sideways across the paper, creating a line of pixels, before the paper moves slightly forward so the next line can be printed. Two basic methods are used to eject ink: thermal, in which ink is heated to form an expanding bubble that expels a droplet from the nozzle, and piezoelectric, in which an electric current expands a crystal causing it to push out the ink droplet. The printer shown here can print digital photographs directly from a memory card.Printer coverCarriage drive beltSettings displayColor ink- cartridge clampBlack ink-cartridge  clampSettings control panelPower buttonOutput trayPC card adapterOutput tray extensionInk-cartridge replacement buttonRoll paper manipulation buttonMaintenance buttonPaper hopperHead data cable supportPreview monitor socketMotor assemblyPaper thickness adjust leverColor ink-cartridge clampSpur gearHead data cablePaper output stackerBlack ink- cartridge clampInk outlet holeColor ink cartridgeInk outlet holeBlack ink cartridge"

The air is forced through tiny pores in a dust bag, trapping most particles. In the 1990s, James Dyson\u2019s dual cyclone \u201cbagless\u201d design did away with the dust bag\u2014and the reduced airflow caused by clogging of its pores. An electrically driven fan creates a partial vacuum within the machine. This sucks air into the machine past a rotating brush that loosens dirt. The air flows into a cylinder-shaped bin. As the air whirls around the bin like a miniature storm, or cyclone, larger particle are flung outward and fall to the bottom of the bin. The air then passes through perforations into a cone-shaped inner bin and then into a series of smaller cones, spinning faster all the time and flinging smaller and smaller particle out. The nearly clean air exits the machine through microfilters that trap the tiniest particles. Some Dyson vacuum cleaners run on  a large ball instead of wheels.

                        "content": "IN A CONVENTIONAL VACUUM CLEANER, an electric motor spins a fan that sucks in air carrying dust and debris. The air is forced through tiny pores in a dust bag, trapping most particles. In the 1990s, James Dyson\u2019s dual cyclone \u201cbagless\u201d design did away with the dust bag\u2014and the reduced airflow caused by clogging of its pores. An electrically driven fan creates a partial vacuum within the machine. This sucks air into the machine past a rotating brush that loosens dirt. The air flows into a cylinder-shaped bin. As the air whirls around the bin like a miniature storm, or cyclone, larger particle are flung outward and fall to the bottom of the bin. The air then passes through perforations into a cone-shaped inner bin and then into a series of smaller cones, spinning faster all the time and flinging smaller and smaller particle out. The nearly clean air exits the machine through microfilters that trap the tiniest particles. Some Dyson vacuum cleaners run on  a large ball instead of wheels.  The ball makes it easier to  steer the cleaner."

The Integer house was designed by Cole Thompson Associates, Bree Day Partnership, and Paul Hodgkins Associates, and built in conjunction with the Building Research Establishment in the UK. One of its key features is a large sun room that warms one side of the house. Extensive use is made of recycled, natural, and renewable materials and energy. The walls are made from timber and insulated with fiber from recycled newspaper; waste water from the bathrooms is saved and used to flush the toilets; and a wind turbine and solar panels contribute some of the electricity requirements.

The Integer house was designed by Cole Thompson Associates, Bree Day Partnership, and Paul Hodgkins Associates, and built in conjunction with the Building Research Establishment in the UK. One of its key features is a large sun room that warms one side of the house. Extensive use is made of recycled, natural, and renewable materials and energy. The walls are made from timber and insulated with fiber from recycled newspaper; waste water from the bathrooms is saved and used to flush the toilets; and a wind turbine and solar panels contribute some of the electricity requirements. Many elements were prefabricated off-site for ease of construction. The Integer house uses only half the energy and a third less water than a traditionally built house."

When a fossil fuel such as coal is burned, it is gone forever, but a renewable source remains available no matter how much is used. The tides, waves, flowing water, sunlight, and the wind are all renewable sources of energy. Wind and water energy are captured by a device called a turbine. The turbine spins and drives an electricity generator. Energy from sunlight, or solar energy, is changed into electricity in two main ways. One uses mirrors to concentrate solar energy and magnify its heating effect which is used to change water into steam to drive turbines. Photovoltaic cells change sunlight directly into electricity. A cell is made from two layers of silicon. One gives out electrons (negative particles) and the other receives them. Sunlight knocks electrons out of atoms where the two layers meet, separating them from the positive particles. The electrons are attracted to one layer of the cell, the positive particles to the other layer. Electrons are naturally attracted to the positive particles, but to come together again, the electrons must flow out of the cell, through an external electric circuit, or load, and back to the other side of the cell, creating a charge. The cell supplies electric current for as long as light keeps falling on it.BladeBlade pitch controlHub controllerAerodynamic hub coverBlade bearingBlade hubRotor lockMain floodgate closed as tide fallsTurbine floodgate opened by winch allows trapped water to flow out to the open seaRoad bridge across an estuaryRising tide passes through main floodgate into estuaryOpen seaWinch operates turbine floodgateTurbine floodgate closed, trapping water behind itEscaping water drives turbine"

The world is divided into 24 time  zones, measured in relation to 12 noon Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), on the Greenwich Meridian (0°). Time advances by one hour for every 15° longitude east of Greenwich (and goes back one hour for every 15° west), but the system is adjusted in line with administrative boundaries.

It normally has 12 months but in leap years, which occur seven times in every cycle of 19 years, there are 13 months. The years are calculated from the Creation (which is placed at 3761 BC); the months are Nisan, Iyyar, Sivan, Thammuz, Ab, Elul, Tishri, Hesvan, Kislev, Tebet, Sebat, and Adar, with an intercalary month (First Adar) being added in leap years.The Muslim calendar is based on a year of 12 months, each month beginning roughly at the time of the New Moon. The months are Muharram, Safar, Rabi\u2019I, Rabi\u2019II, Jumada I, Jumada II, Rajab, Sha\u2019ban, Ramadan, Shawwal, Dhu l-Qa\u2019dah, and Dhu l-Hijja.The Chinese calendar is a lunar calendar, with a year consisting of 12 months. Intercalary months are added to keep the calendar in step with the solar year of 365 days. Months are referred to by a number within a year, but also by animal names that, from ancient times, have been attached to years and hours of the day."
